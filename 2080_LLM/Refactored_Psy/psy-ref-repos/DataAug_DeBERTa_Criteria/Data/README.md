# Data Directory

This directory hosts all datasets required for the multi-agent DSM-5 pipeline.

## Criteria Matching Data

- `groundtruth/redsm5_ground_truth.json`: JSONL file containing Reddit posts annotated with DSM-5 criteria.
- `DSM-5/DSM_Criteria_Array_Fixed_Major_Depressive.json`: DSM-5 criteria definitions aligned with annotation IDs.

## Evidence Binding Data (Removed)

This project has been simplified to a single-task architecture (criteria matching only). Evidence binding datasets and span-training are no longer used.
