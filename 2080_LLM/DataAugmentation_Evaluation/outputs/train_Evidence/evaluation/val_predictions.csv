You smoke less and less at home, even though you're stressed because of your job, and you're beginning to exercise again.

I think it's obvious for anyone that knows me a little that I have depression, and it still has some deep deep roots in me, and I think I'll never get rid of them. You support me so much. I truly love you. You're an amazing person and a fantastic partner. I thought you would be my cure to finally get a hold of myself and move on in life, and find a purpose.

s_2958_116,"I feel like my need for meaning is alienating. Do any of you feel this way? Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues. Do any of you feel the same way?

s_2815_1002,"30 years ago today, my neighbor's son disappeared. 30 years ago, my neighbors across the street, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, endured a terrible loss. Their son, Adam, disappeared on Halloween. It was assumed he was kidnapped, as there was a rash of kidnappings in the area at the time. The kidnapper was never found, though. Neither was Adam. Todays the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. To the Steins, the wounds are still fresh. They refuse to decorate their yard, despite all the houses on the street going out of their way to be as festive as possible. They dont give out candy, despite the rest of the houses on the street trying to one-up each other by giving out better loot than their neighbors. The Steins mourn quietly in their dark house; the television being the only light emanating from their window. Kids are advised by their parents not to knock. Ive always felt bad for them. Ive lived here for 40 years. I remember the frantic search and rescue efforts that swept through our town. Even though I was barely 20 years old and living with my unemployed father while working double shifts to pay our mortgage, I did my part and joined the search. It was the least I could do. Like all futile searches, it ended after a while. Adam was presumed dead. The Steins grew old and the neighborhood changed around us. New families moved in and old ones either died off or moved out. Aside from me and the Steins, Id say the average age of the homeowners here is 35. And they all have lots of kids. A terrible rumor started to spread a couple years ago. I know who started it - an older kid named Chuck Demopoulos. He told his younger brothers and neighborhood friends that Adams ghost haunts the woods behind our street. He said Mr. Stein killed him and chopped him up into little bits. When I learned about the rumor, I was disgusted. The disrespect was so vulgar and uncalled for. I prayed the Steins wouldnt hear about it, but Im sure they must have. It was pervasive. I called Chucks father and told him what I heard, and I suspect Chuck caught a beating for it. Still, Im afraid the damage had already been done. Despite pitying the Steins, I dont express my sympathy by refusing to decorate my house and yard. I love Halloween. Always have. I like to see parents beaming from the street while their kids nervously ring doorbells and collect piles of candy. The spirit of the season keeps me feeling young, despite being well past my prime and having to deal with high blood-pressure. Being an old timer has its perks sometimes. I have Halloween decorations they dont sell anymore. Ghoulish stuff like hangmans nooses - things that are too politically incorrect for stores to sell. I firmly believe Halloween shouldnt be sanitized. It should be scary and unsettling. That said, there needs to be an emotional component, too. Not just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. There needs to be poignancy. Something thatll stick with you after you see it. Thats why Adam helps me decorate. After Dad died in 1989, I emptied out his safety deposit box. There was an envelope with note a note and a Polaroid photograph. All the note said was, I caught him snooping around the cellar. I had to teach him a lesson. The photograph was of fresh cement drying on the basement wall. In the middle of the night, I went into the cellar and opened the wall. Adams body was inside. My instinctive reaction was to call the police, but I was terrified Id be arrested. Theyd never believe the note. So I sealed the wall. After a while, I stopped thinking about the dead boy in the bowels of my house. Many years later, after talking with Mrs. Stein about Adam on a Halloween afternoon, I knew what I had to do. I took his remains out of the wall in 2014. He was only a skeleton. I separated the bones, splashed them with fake blood, and incorporated them into my Halloween decorations. At first, I was worried. As the days went by, though, I realized I didnt need to be concerned. The bones blended in with the rest of my decorations. Just more festive material in a neighborhood chock full of it. This morning, when I went out to get the paper, Mr. Stein was doing the same. We met in the street and chatted for a while. We talked about the Cowboys game from last night and he mentioned his wife made a spectacular coffee cake that hed bring me a piece of later. I smiled and told him that would be real nice. Before we parted ways, Mr. Stein said, I never told you how much Shannon and I appreciated all the help you gave us back when we lost Adam. We knew how busy you were. Its been 30 years today, you know. I felt guilt and sadness wash over me. Im sure hes in a better place, I told him. He nodded, and I saw tears in his eyes. He was a good boy. I know wherever he is, hes watching over us. We hugged briefly, then went back to our respective homes. I walked up the driveway, past the ghosts dangling from my trees by their nooses, and headed up my front steps. I looked at the skull hanging above the doorway. It was pointed at the Steins house.

I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault). It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure. Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this? In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy. BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset. If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time.

s_3028_518,"My OCD Story (A Journey into Scrupulosity) *Warning: Wall of text post here, but this is my story
I think a part of me died about six years ago. I could not tell you what happened in January 2009 that caused me to start hearing what I thought were voices in my head. I do remember the hours I would spend obsessing over what these voices said to me. I do remember the pain I felt when I butchered one of my ritualistic phrases and said that I ""worship the devil"" on accident. I do remember how I begged God and pleaded for Him to have mercy on my soul. The only thing I wanted was my sanity. --------
The voices did not stop. After awhile, the hope that was alive inside my body died. There was no place for me to confide. My parents emotionally abandoned me as a child. I always knew they were there for me when I needed to be controlled. If I ever forgot the rules, I knew they would remind me. As far as dealing with the wounds that life gave me, I was on my own. I stood alone. I stood in silence. I stood as a seventeen year-old boy who thought he was schizophrenic. I knew those voices were after me. I knew those demons were trying to kill my soul. I started waking up in the middle of the night because I needed to complete my rituals; I needed to defend myself from those voices. There were nights when I would toss and turn in my bed, begging for peace. I felt as if my soul was on fire. I was screaming through the flames and there was no one there to rescue me. There was no place for me to run. There was no way to escape my mind. ------
There was also no one for me to confess. There was no comfort for me. Here I was, left in this wilderness alone. I knew time was coming to an end, soon. I believed Jesus was coming back soon. It could be any day now. I did not understand why I had to lose my sanity and my salvation, this close to the end of the world. I tried to do everything right: follow all of the rules, go to Sunday school, love my neighbor, all of the Christian mannerisms. I did not know why God was mad at me, but I knew He was done with me. I accepted this as my hell bound fate and continued to wander the wilderness. --------
After four years of hiding in shame and suffering, I finally came out and told one of my close friends I thought I was schizophrenic. He encouraged me to go to the school counseling office at my university. I learned a significant amount about my past during that time, however, I did not admit the ""voices"" I was hearing. After I started to lose my sanity more and my symptoms became harder to hide, I decided to see a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Depression. ---------
When most people think of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, they often depict the man who cannot leave his house until he touches his doorknob three times. Some of my most common obsessions include contamination, doubting, and checking. The following are examples of my thoughts: ""I left the door unlocked and someone is going to break into my house and steal my valuables. Did I turn the iron off? I left the iron on and now my house is going to burn down. Did I run over someone while I was driving? I hope this person burns in Hell"" I could list many other disturbing thoughts, but I am often ashamed to admit these thoughts. Initially, I thought these were the demonic voices I was hearing. These violent, twisted thoughts were extremely contradictory to my normal thought pattern. I knew the thoughts could not belong to me. As I began to learn about OCD, I knew it was the disease that plagued my life. My OCD began with scrupulosity and has manifested into many forms of OCD. No one understands OCD's toll on life quality: all I wanted was peace, however, reality became hell. I feel damned. ---------
After all of the things that have changed in my life, nothing was the same. I have lost a part of me in this wilderness: hope. I have stopped hoping for things to get better. I have stopped hoping for my prayers to be answered. I stopped asking God to heal me from this disease. I stopped asking God to take me back. I was forced to grow up in this wilderness. I emerged as a new man and I don't know if I will ever reclaim my previous sense of self. I cannot allow myself to hope again; hope hurts too much. Ahh, you think darkness is your ally? I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding. --The Dark Knight Rises",A.1,True,0,1,[],"[(-1, -1)]",,

s_1514_41,"The Pledge I was skeptical when my online friends first linked me to the supposed evil Kickstarter that was going viral on the less-than-wholesome forums we frequented. We were an unmoderated haven for trolls, weirdos, and radicals, sure, but this Kickstarter was something else entirely. It seemed to have no publicly stated goal; the writers had only promised something awesome if the funding amount was reached. Stranger still, the rewards were all hidden except for the first level. In the Pledge $1 or more' box the text read: ""Want to get started? Throw in $1, and you'll receive access to the higher pledge tiers. Also, two things will happen. You will have a minor intangible wish granted, and we will send you a video of one of us kicking a random stranger! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" Tomorrow? Don't these rewards usually only get sent out after full funding? But I understood what they were going for. This was a gimmick to get attention, and judging by the high number of backers listed in the box, it was working. Screw it, I thought. I'll throw in a dollar and see what happens. As I woke up the next morning, I trudged around the kitchen making coffee and then sat sipping it at the table while trying to escape the grogginess of sleep. All I wanted was a day to myself to avoid the grinding monotony of classes. At that moment, my phone dinged. Lifting it, I saw that someone had sent me an email with a video attachment. I instantly became fully awake as I realized what this was. Opening it with trepidation, I hit play and watched. Five teenagers in black hoodies and expressionless white masks ran through an alleyway together, often looking back at the camera and laughing. When they reached the street, they made a beeline for a tired businessman on a bench, and the lead kid ran right up and kicked him in the shin. Confused and angry, the businessman leapt up and began shouting, but the hooligans were already running away. The last few seconds of the video were a close-up of a white mask and dark emotionless eyeholes as they fled the scene. The speaker said, ""This one's for you, Jason Phillips. Thanks for your dollar pledge!"" It would be an understatement to say I was put off. They were actually going around kicking people in return for a dollar! I had to call the police. I picked up my phone again, moved to action by the fear that I might be liable for thisbut my phone dinged again. I had a text message and an email from the official college department telling me that classes were cancelled today on account of a bomb threat. I sat in silence until it hit me: I'd just been wishing for a day to myself. Had these violent teenagers guessed that would be my minor wish? Had they called in a bomb threat to get me the day off? I shivered. I couldn't call the police. I couldn't be connected to this. I would be expelled at best and jailed at worst. They might even look into my history of trolling online, and then I'd really be screwed. How the hell had they gotten my name? Had I been so stupid as to use my real credit card? I flipped through the logs and confirmation emails, but noI'd taken the proper precaution and used an anonymous cash card. How had they gotten my information? My friends had to be in on it. This was all a prank! Well, they'd gotten me good. There was probably no bomb threat at all. The text had likely been faked or spoofed somehow. Smiling the whole way, I went to class anyway. But it was cancelled, and cops were everywhere. Rather than going home, I stopped in a Starbucks and pulled out my laptop. Was it paranoia to avoid using my computer at home? Something about this seemed off. Checking the Kickstarter again to try to understand what was happening, I saw that I'd been given access to the $5 tier. "" Now that you've seen we're legit, why not up the stakes a little? Pledge five bucks and we'll get you something tangible of your choice worth $500 or less. We'll also send you a video of us punching a stranger in the face! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" I could actually feel my circulatory system in my torso thanks to the stressed beats within. It was not a pleasant feeling. But pay $5 and get something worth $500? The first thing that came to mind was that gaming console I couldn't afford. All my classmates were talking about the greatest new games, but could only watch gameplay videos online to carry on the charade that I had them myself. In some sense, I believed that the Kickstarter videos were staged and that the end parts with the close-up and my spoken name were edited onto the end of each file they sent out. Reassuring myself, I pledged five bucks. I drank more than my share of beer that night with my roommates. Trying to pretend like everything was fine, I forced smiles and told some jokes. One of my friends mentioned that I seemed strained, but I laughed it off and said it was just the stress of upcoming finals. The beer helped me sleep, but I awoke with a start and ran downstairs as morning light shimmered in through the windows. There was already a package on my doorstep. It was addressed to someone named Ricardo Jimenez, along with a note that read ""Happy Birthday, son!"" I opened it, but I already knew what it was: someone else's gaming system had been diverted to my address. As I opened the box, my phone dinged, and my blood ran cold. Were they teenagers? They were thin and lanky under their black hoodies and blue jeans, but their masks hid any identifying features. Watching them run, I noticed their gait seemed odd, and I steeled myself as they burst out of a different alley and ran at a haggard mother pushing a baby carriage. I screamed at my phone, ""No!""but it was useless. The lead hooligan ran straight at her and popped her in the side of the face with a punch that took a straight line. From that, I knew they were the same height as her. I absorbed that fact to counter the horrible feeling that I'd caused this to happen to some unsuspecting mother on the street. Again, a mask filled the video view for the final sequence. "" Thanks for your five dollar pledge, Jason Phillips! I hope you enjoy those games!"" The gaming system found a new home in a dumpster five blocks away from my apartment. I couldn't keep it, not after what I'd seen, and I certainly couldn't sell it without confirming intent for any police that might be chasing these guys down. On the walk back, I took a roundabout route, and I eyed every car around me with suspicion. No one seemed to be taking note of my presence but why should they? To the real world, I was just a random college senior. They had no idea what I did or said online. Classes blurred by. I could think of nothing else but the Kickstarter. I knew I would see another new pledge level if I looked again, but I feared what I would find. Between classes, I tried to contact the friends that had linked me to it. None of them were responding. I was still half-certain they were somehow in on it, but the feeling this whole thing was giving meI just couldn't be sure anymore. My resistance lasted two days. Ostensibly, I was checking to see when the mysterious goalless Kickstarter was ending, but I couldn't help but glance down and see the $10 tier. "" You're in it now, friend! For your amazing support of ten dollars, we will free you from an intangible chain that's weighing you down. We'll also send you another of those videos you love. In this one, we'll non-fatally stab someone just for you! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" Stab someone? Jesus Christ! But an intangible chain weighing me down? God, my student loans! I hit the Pledge button without letting myself debate further. My student loan debt was over eighty-thousand dollars, and it represented a lifetime of tithing servitude that I would never fully repay, not with the way the economy was going. Wine was my friend that night rather than beer. I sat watching pirated movies online until the sun came up, not bearing to think about what I'd done. At the same time, I very much needed this to be real. When the Student Financial Services office opened, I was there. As I barged in the instant the clock hit the hour, a blonde fellow student looked up in surprise. "" Can I help you?"" ""Yes, I need to check my debt balance."" I tried my best to look calm, but I guessed my terse restraint just made me that much more suspicious. "" My name's Jason Phillips. Here's my student ID and papers."" ""Sure,"" she said, taking my paperwork and turning to her computer. After a moment of typing, she began to recite, ""If this is about a payment, you can go to our"" She stopped typing. "" Looks like you have a zero balance."" Barely able to keep myself from shaking in my sneakers, I clarified, ""No debt? It got paid off?"" She shook her head. "" You've never taken out a loan with us at all. You're enrolled, but the Registrar's database says you've paid in cash every term."" ""From what accounts?"" I asked, forcing a nonchalant smile. ""Oh, we don't have access to that here."" She gave a small laugh. "" I'm just here through work study. Is something wrong? I'd kill to be debt-free."" My phone dinged in my pocket. "" Don't say that,"" I told her far more seriously than I intended. "" Don't say that."" Out in the hallway, I sat and watched the video. The same five black-hoodied, white-masked thugs were running through an alley. As they emerged onto the street and headed for a bald teenage girl in a shirt that read 'I stood strong, I fought hard, I won', I closed the video and put it away. I couldn't watch it. I recognized that kind of shirt from my father's own struggle with cancer. The shaking wouldn't stop, and I imagined I was bright red from the absolute chaos going on inside my chest. Oh God, I was free of the debt, free of the weight of eighty-thousand dollars that had racked up when my father's illness ate my college fund. I was free of the debt and I was happy for it. I was happy! Meanwhile, some teenage girl that had just survived the unthinkable was about to be stabbed in exchange. My only consolation, as spit and tears plopped onto the floor by my sneakers, was that the pledge box had specified non-fatal. ""Are you alright?"" It was my turn to look up in surprise. ""It's not often that someone comes in freaked out and sad that they have no debt,"" the blonde girl from the front desk said. "" Something's the matter, isn't it?"" After studying my face, she sat next to me. "" I'm Kelly."" ""Jason,"" I told her, unable to look her in the eye. ""Why don't you tell me what's wrong, Jason?"" It all spilled out of me in one long babbling wave. The Kickstarter, the pledge tiers, the bomb threat, the kick, the gaming system, the punch in the face, the cancelled student loan debt; she sat and listened to all of it, wary. After I was done, she nodded once, narrowed her eyes, and then said, ""Show me the video."" That was not the reaction I'd expected. I'd been braced for disbelief or having the cops called on me. Instead, I asked, ""Are you sure? ""Just show it to me."" She took the phone and watched without visible reaction. After I heard it say my name and thank me for the ten dollar pledge, she said, ""Well, they stabbed her. But I think she'll live."" I finally found myself able to look at her. Now that someone else knew, I wasn't so gripped by terror and self-loathing. "" You're not scared?"" ""I don't know enough to be scared yet. Do you have the other two videos on this phone?"" She watched the previous two with the same calculating gaze. Once they were over, she said, ""They always originate out of sight. Why is that? And who exactly is doing the filming? Tonight, let's get these on a bigger monitor and watch for reflections. These look like random city streets. There's no way they've got all the angles coveredand if they do, you'll know it's fake."" After a sigh and a nod, I told her, ""I have a desktop computer at home. Two big monitors."" ""You a Computer Science major?"" ""Alright, here's my number. Text me your address and I'll come by after work and classes."" Taking my phone back with a sense of dumbfounded shame and hope, I asked, ""Why are you helping me?"" ""Maybe I'm one of them,"" she said with complete neutrality. "" And this is just a way of secretly getting closer to you."" I laughed nervously, but she returned to the Student Financial Services office without taking it back or even hinting that she was joking. Something about her deadpan attitude made her seem trustworthy or maybe I was just desperate to have help in this. But I had no other option anyway. That night, I sent her my address, and she showed up with a laptop of her own and sat at my desk alongside me. I loaded up the videos on my large monitors, and we began to go through them frame by frame, staring at every single blur and corner. ""Hackers of some sort,"" she guessed, drinking from a very large fountain soda she'd brought. "" You'd be surprised the kind of information they can get online."" ""Oh, I'm no stranger to hacking,"" I replied, feeling much better now that I had an ally. "" I basically live on the Internet. Career no-lifer here. But this is a whole other level. Calling in bomb threats, redirecting mail, cancelling debt, and all without any police attention that I've seen: these guys are good."" She glanced up at one of the tab names in my browser bar above the video. "" You frequent that forum?"" Red-faced, I quickly closed the tab. "" I'm not a brony, I swear. I was just trying to get info on these guys."" ""I believe you,"" she said sardonically. There was nothing in the first or second video, even going frame by frame. "" Could just be unlucky,"" she commented. "" Load up the third one."" I glanced over at my small digital clock. "" Are you sure? It's two in the morning."" ""I'm sure. There's something here."" Again, I had to ask: ""Why are you helping me?"" She looked me straight in the eyes, which I'd found was rare for her. "" It's a mystery. Don't you want to solve it?"" ""They're hurting people."" My heart was beating fast again, for many reasons. "" This is messed up. They're halfway to their fundraising goal, and I don't even know what'll happen when they reach it!"" ""Could be some sort of terrorist attack,"" she mused. "" But that doesn't seem right. These guys have some sort of moral code lurking behind their cheery shenanigans. They're giving you things, but they're also hurting people. Before we look at the third video, what's the next pledge tier?"" I opened up the Kickstarter and stared. "" You've come so far in support of our grand goal! What's a few more dollars? Pledge $25 and we'll get you something tangible that will go a long way towards your happiness and freedom. Our video offering here is also pretty kickasspun intended. With this tier, we'll send you a video of us kicking someone you know! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" She looked to me. "" The cost in violence appears to have gone down."" ""But now it's someone I know,"" I said with hesitation. "" But what does that mean? What level of being familiar with someone means I know them? Do they mean my friends online? Classmates here?"" ""The choice is yours,"" she replied, still neutral. "" But that seems like a small price to pay for more information. A fourth video would help, along with seeing them in action again."" ""That's true."" I'd been thinking that myself. Before I could second-guess the decision, I clicked the Pledge button again. She gazed around my bedroom. "" Nothing happened."" ""Well yeah, it's not immediate."" ""Then let's go over this video."" We began going through the third video frame by frame, looking for any hint of editing or angles that might show something the five masked, lanky figures had missedand I lost all feeling in my limbs for a moment as I finally saw it. Pointing, I drew Kelly's attention to a reflection on a passing car window. Five black hoodies and white masks could be seen, but. ""There's nobody filming,"" she said with confusion. "" That's where the camera should be, right?"" I half-shouted. "" There's the pole that just passed on the left! Where's the cameraman? Where's the camera?!"" While I got up and began to pace back and forth in a panic, she sat in her chair, staring down at the desk and murmuring to herself, ""Hacking, coding, digital alterationburied for us to findthey want us to be scared. They didn't make a single mistake in the first two videos. They knew we'd comb through and find it. All part of the gimmick."" ""Yeah, yeah. That has to be it!"" ""But to edit the reflection on glass on a moving car so perfectly,"" she continued, rocking back and forth slightly. "" It's amazing."" She snapped out of it then and looked at me. "" It's too late to walk through the city. I'm staying here tonight."" Just like that, one confusing terror drained out me to be replaced by another. ""... She slept on the other side of my bed while I remained awake. I was getting increasingly fatigued, but I was far too tense to sleep for many reasons. Morning came as a gradual grey lightening, and I sat up wearily just as the sounds of a loud and heavy truck began emanating from outside my window. Kelly awoke and popped up instantly with no sign of exhaustion. Together, we went outside to see a heavy-set man operating a winch to lower a sports car onto the pavement. "" You Jason Phillips?"" ""Got some ID?"" I showed him. He grunted. "" This car's for you, kid. What'd you do, get all A's and your parents bought you a car? This one's an easy hundred-thousand. Must have been some tough classes."" Staring, I said nothing. He handed me the title after I signed something on a clipboard, and, suddenly, I was the new owner of a Lamborghini. The deliveryman knew nothing of interest, only that the order had come in online and cleared, and I was left to sit in my new sports car while my phone dinged every so often to remind me I had a new video. This didn't do it for me. I didn't care about a car. I wasn't really that material. Exceptwhat else had the tier said? Something about freedom? A car meant the ability to travel. With a car, class would no longer be a twenty minute walk away. I could give rides to people, curry favor... impress girls. I looked over at Kelly, who stood studying the title and paperwork. Did this kind of thing impact her at all? Nothing seemed to faze her. But I was not nearly as stoic. The fourth video immediately began in a dark gap between two houses, and the five white-masked perpetrators ran across the street toward a house I recognized. As they broke in the door and the sounds of my mother screaming reached my ears, I watched in abject horror as the invaders broke my dad's at-home medical machines and began brutally kicking him until he was crawling on the floor. Exact grammar was important: the first tier had said that one of them would kick a random stranger. This latest tier had simply said the video would be of 'us' kicking someone I knew. I hadn't paid close enough attention! My jaw began trembling as I watched the five run from the house, laughing. "" Jason Phillips, thanks for your continued donations!"" ""What is it?"" Kelly asked. Through the open car window, I handed her the phone in silence. She watched it calmly. "" This is great."" I screamed. "" Did you see what they did?!"" They entered a place they did not control, and by the color of the sky it looks like they literally just did this. They'll have screwed up this time. They didn't give themselves a chance to edit the video. Get inside and get this on your monitor."" Wiping away tears, I did as instructed, and we began going over the fourth video frame by frame. It was gut-wrenching to see my father beaten so brutally after what he'd already survived, and to know that I did thatit was something I could never apologize for. Kelly said, ""The Kickstarter's almost at its goal."" Glancing at my other monitor, I saw only a sliver remaining to be filled. It was me, wasn't it? It was counting down for me. I kept finding excuses to gain things at the cost of others, and I kept finding ways to feel confused or surprised about the result to shirk responsibility. It had clearly stated what would happen in each tier. In fact, while Kelly continued studying the fourth video, my eyes strayed to the fifth and final tier: ""Are you ready for the Change? Pledge the maximum amount and we'll reach our goal. Untold wonders await our most devoted supporters. We'll also send you a video of us killing someone you know! Don't worry, it won't be a family member. Estimated Delivery: Immediate!"" Untold wonders? What could that entail? They'd already done such incredible things, but they'd all been within the realm of possibility via computers and social engineering so far. Next to me, Kelly gasped. "" They missed one. They missed a reflection!"" She grasped my arm, but I just kept staring at the Pledge button. Untold wonders? "" They're not human! Jason, look! You have to look!"" My hand floated to my mouse, and I moved the pointer over the Pledge button. I had an idea of who would be sacrificed, if not a family member. Kelly seemed like a great person, strange in some ways, very caring in others, but did I really value her as highly as whatever these untold wonders were? I didn't know her that well, but yes. She was human, and she was alive, just like me. This wasn't some anonymous person on the Internet that I was slinging insults at. This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world. God, I'd been a terrible person. The stress of my father's illness and the pressure on my finances and family had pushed me in a dark direction; a direction I now had to resist. I let out a sigh and released the mouse. The spell was broken. It was over. The madness was over. ""No more,"" I said with relief. "" I can't go down this road any further. It's just not right."" I turned and froze; the ominous black maw of a gun barrel had been pointed at the back of my head, and it was now directly touching the bridge of my nose. "" She slowly withdrew the weapon and slotted it into an unseen holster. Still eerily calm, she began to walk away. ""What was all this?"" I called after her from my seat, my mind racing from the adrenaline. "" Jesus, was this a test?"" She paused at my door. Without looking back at me, she said softly, ""Yes. A test for admittanceand you failed."" Her gaze turned slowly toward me, and now that she was no longer putting on an act, I understood that her expressionlessness was that of an animated corpse. "" But I'm glad you did. You wouldn't like it where we're from."" With that, she was gone, and I was left to quiver in my chair, process what had happened, and stare at the one reflection the editors had missed in the fourth video: the face of the cameraman. It was a demonic, hollow-eyed, maggot-infested sneering visage; it was a face that would haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life. It was my facealmost. ---

s_1072_1187,"Started opening up. I finished school seven and a half years ago. Since then, I've been studying one thing after the other - almost all unsuccessfully - on my parents' dime, while living in a flat they paid for. Every semester, it would be the same pattern: I'd stop attending class, lie to my parents and my live-in girlfriend about it, and then have a fight at the end of the semester when my results came. Once, I even forged exam results, which hurt my family deeply. I've been to see therapists, but it never took. At the start of this year, both my parents and my girlfriend told me this was my last chance. I finally admitted today that I'd failed everything and that I need help. I packed a bag of clothes and my computer and went to stay with my parents. Everything sucks and I have no future, but everyone loves me and is willing to help. I wish I could have avoided these mistakes in the first place. My girlfriend is extremely dependent on me for getting to and from work and for buying stuff and keeping the house clean, and now I'm not there to help her. And my parents have sunk so much money into giving me third and fourth and fifth chances, so much so that they've had to dig into their retirement fund - they're in their mid-50s and have sunk a lot of money into two business ventures, one of which tanked and the other one is only going to be profitable enough for my dad to get a good salary in a few years' time.

s_1601_96,"I was lucky enough to have attended private school all of my life (except for two months, since I emigrated in April during 2nd grade, and only public school allowed me to get in for the remaining two months). From Grade 5, I attended a catholic smallish school, and on top of that, from Grade 7 to Senior Year, we were all girls. Bullying didn't really happen, and everyone fitted in (no one was left alone, unless they chose to be alone). Girls fight and hate on each other behind each other's back haha. However, my self-esteem dropped immensely some time in Grade 8. I have no idea why. I know it's related to school. I became extremely self-conscious. One of the many reasons I like to blame was that it was in Grade 8 that we started a project, which was a student exchange with kids our age in Mexico. I personally really wanted to just build a cool friendship with someone, and I was unfortunately matched with the 'hottest guy'. We talked, but soon enough I noticed him using me to get to the pretty girls of my year. When they finally came in Grade 9, I went to him to say hi, and he was like ""Hey! You're 'train_subject9951', right?"" and I was really happy he remembered me, but seconds later, he turned his back and started talking to another classmate of mine, who, for some reason, decided not to wear much that day. I was both unhappy and kind of shocked, because, well, I'm not a pretty girl. Felt like all the attention I'll ever get from there on would be from being pretty, which I am not. Girls like girls with whom they can relate to, and most girls of my school were into partying, makeup ... being stereotypical teenage girls. I was not like them. My social skills then dropped to absolute zero, my self-esteem reached an all-time low, and I slowly started secluding myself.

s_796_391,"Is it too late to get in shape? I thought so but thank goodness I was wrong! I'm a 35 year old father of four. I design for a living and lived a sedentary lifestyle up until about 6 months ago. I smoked, never played sports, overweight for the most part of my life, had severe sleep apnea, and was a former meth addict (college years. The habit forced me to drop out of an engineering degree on my 3rd year.) A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I was taking a progressive dose of anti-depressants. The meds were supposed to make me feel somehow confident and uplifted- and was supposed to help me cope with my OCD as well. It made me feel OK at first but later on it made me feel empty and suicidal. After a while of taking it, I found myself no longer enjoying that things that I used to enjoy- like making art, designing merchandise, and cooking. I suspect these activities are somehow tied to my OCD. I spoke to my family doctor about it and she suggested that perhaps I should try natural means of defeating my mental illness such as exposure therapy and exercise. Due to my plantar fasciitis and joints, back, and knees problem- the only exercise that she would allow me to do was swimming. Thanks to my social anxiety- I abhor swimming. July 2015. My 15 yr old girl and 6 yr old boy joined a Muay Thai gym in our area. Driving them and picking them up from the gym became my exposure therapy of sorts. I like the vibe but was very hesitant because I always had the mindset that I was not made for sports. At the urging of my wife and kids (we live in a tiny apartment and, thanks to my severe apnea, they can't stand my snoring anymore) I decided to join them. My doctor was against it but I was born a rebel so I persevered and I found that I thoroughly enjoyed the sport. I have since lost more than 20 lbs and I continue to burn anywhere between 1-3 lbs per week. My relationship with my wife and family is now waaaay better and I no longer need my prescription. Being physically fit changed my life.

*********Detailed diet and exercise routine:*********
I jumpstarted my diet change by [eating nothing but sardines with rice and olives](<URL>) (and a lot of greens) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the entire month of November 2015. From December onwards- I pretty much eat anything that I cook and serve my kids but in moderation (I have a Filipino background and we consume a lot of rice. I used to eat more than 2 cups per meal but now I'm down to 1). I have my cheat days on Fridays and have pizza and soda. On Saturdays I workout even if I don't really have to so I can eat my Tim Horton's chocolate dip donut. I drink a medium sized 1 cream 1 sugar coffee in the morning and sometimes at night as well. I smoke marijuana 10 minutes before workout and throughout the day actually. I still smoke the occasional cigarette but I can now go for days without it. I have four kids and a business to run so I sleep anywhere between 3-6 hours only every night. *********Exercise routine:*********
Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Muay Thai conditioning and some bag/pad work
Saturday: Light warm up and some bag work
What is Muay Thai conditioning? It varies but basically it's about 45minutes - 1hour of nonstop workout followed by about half an hour of hitting the pads or the heavy bag. Here's a sample workout:
Warm up routine:
*3-10 minutes skipping rope or 10-20 minutes run
*3 sets of 40 jumping jacks, 40 front back front, 40 alternating knees, 40 right kick ups, 40 left kick ups, 15 jump squats
Heavy bag routine:
*4 sets of 25 right swing kicks, 25 left swing kicks, 25 right push kicks, 25 left push kicks, 50 speed jabs and cross punches. [ Here's a video of me and my wife doing 50 swing kicks each each leg](<URL>). *********Here are some tips that help me get from point A to point B.*********
* BE TRUE TO YOURSELF. I admitted to myself that I was sick and I needed help. And so I did admit and I did it publicly. I joined Movember on 2014 and [I blogged about my struggle on my own business website](<URL>). Some people thought that it would be the end of my business career for coming out like that but instead my business received more interest. Nobody joined me on my Movember campaign though. * USE SOCIAL MEDIA. Let your intent be known. I always wanted to be fit but the attachment to my bad habits was strong. When I was trying to quit smoking, I read somewhere that it would be helpful if you let your family and friends know that you're quitting. There's a psychology behind this but that's beyond my area of expertise. So on November 2015 I participated in Movember once more and told my followers in Facebook about it. I also made a cringe-worthy [Movember day 1 video](<URL>). I only managed to get 1 MoBro supporter- my personal trainer but that was enough to motivate me. * ADD SOME GIMMICK. The more dramatic the better. It's fun for you (and your audience and those around you will react positively!). Example: [I ate nothing but sardines with rice and olives](<URL>) for breakfast, lunch, and dinner everyday for the entire month of November. [ I skipped rope with PVC rope wearing my suit and tie](<URL>). There are other crazy stuff that I did but the idea is to push yourself and enjoy doing it. * INVOLVE YOUR LOVED ONES. Be an inspiration to each other. Actually, in my case, my wife and kids involved me. My kids are so into Muay Thai that my 6y/o asked me to make him a [Youtube channel dedicated to Muay Thai](<URL>). My 15 y/o girl can't wait to fight in the ring, and even our [2 y/o twins are active in the gym](<URL>). Edit 2: 50 kicks each leg for a total of 100 kicks per person.

It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone. My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later. I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days.

This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to.

I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now.

When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text.

Currently I hover around 7075 kgs which is ideal with my height and gets me the tall and lean frame which I like. I am not paranoid over diets and counting calorie intake and maintaining a deficit. I just listen to my body, so to say, and did the below mentioned things at the time which helped me lose all that weight (and get a jawline which I didnt know I had) Strictly no sugar no sweets, no adding it over curd, no pastries. This was the hardest because I love Gulab Jamuns and pastries. Working out. Not being a gym freak, but my regimen had lots of cardio and limited lifting. I also love CrossFit and incorporated it in my regimen. Intermittent fasting. Eat nothing for 16-hours. Have your food in an 8-hour period. LOTS of walking. I never counted the steps at the time, but I walked A LOT. And its one of the major factors to help you in losing weight. Eating Makhanas (Fox Nuts) while binge watching. Highly recommended binge-watching snack. One light meal of Poha/Upma/Dalia/Khichdi every day. Eggs amp; chicken are good for proteins but I avoided non-veg during that time. No drinking. Beer might be a boon to give you the courage to finally text her, but beer belly is a bitch that doesnt leave. There wasnt much fat shaming.

Logically I can tell myself ""well it's 5am and she's 14, she's asleep"" but my anxiety tells me that she's definitely been murdered. A car pulls up outside my apartment? Logically it's probably one of the other 10 tenants in my building. Anxiety says it's my landlord coming to evict me (even though I've paid rent and there's no reason) or it's maybe someone coming to murder me (no reason for someone to want to) or any number of things. Basically I'm in a constant state of flight or fight. Logically I can know I'm safe but my mind is always telling me ""no, worst case scenario is happening"". And it's everything, too. Yesterday my cat didn't come running when I filled her food bowl, logic: she usually doesn't, most days she is lazy and takes her time. Anxiety: she's definitely hurt.

s_433_1570,"We're always told Hamlet's famous ""To be or not to be"" was a soliloquy. A Monologue is a speech that is spoken to someone else, or at least another character on the stage hears it. A Soliloquy, is a speech spoken to nobody, and only the audience hears it, not any other character in the play. So which is this? When Shakespeare writes dialog, they say what they mean. If hes talking about Love, hes in love. If hes talking about killing someone, hes angry and really wants to kill them. It is, for the most part, difficult to lie in Shakespearean speech, without a stage direction saying, He or She is lying. There are exceptions, but they just have to be supported by the text. The things other people say, or what that character says before or after the incident in question. In other words, they do say what they mean, unless there is evidence to support otherwise. What is it even saying anyway? To be, or not to be...
Be as in existing. To exist or not to exist, to live or not to live. Okay, hes openly questioning if he should live or die. So, this speech is about whether or not Hamlet should kill himself, which isnt totally out of the blue; at the beginning of the play, the first time Hamlet is onstage alone, he contemplates it there as well. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them. Which is better? Just take my wealth and position, keeping my mouth shut, but be racked with guilt over it, or to actually stand up for what I believe in, even though it would destroy and kill me and my family? To die, to sleep-
No more, and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. But if Im dead, no more pain, no more suffering, no more guilt, and all the problems I have now just go away. Hey, that sounds pretty good...
To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, theres the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause. Theres the respect
That makes calamnity of so long life...
And if its all just a long sleep, whats on that other side? Its supposed to be so wonderful; thats why we endure all the crap in this world. It goes on, but we can see its basically a suicide note of sorts, or at least a contemplation on the part of Hamlet. Just before Hamlet comes on stage to give this speech, Claudius and Polonius, the murderous King and his Crony are talking with Ophelia, Polonius daughter, and Queen Gertrude. The Queen leaves... okay, now 3 on the stage. Polonius
then says:
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves. Hes telling Ophelia, Hamlets Girlfriend, to hang out here. But we will bestow ourselves.? The archaic meaning of bestow is to stow, deposit, store. So... lets store ourselves? Lets stow ourselves? Theyre saying, Lets go hide, which they then do. They exit, and Hamlet enters, talking all morbid. But Ophelia is still on-stage. There is no Ophelia exits, nor is there Ophelia re-enters, so shes there the whole time while Hamlet talks about killing himself. So, is the speech an aside that no one else hears? No, because at least one other person hears it, if not three. Hamlet finishes, then sees Ophelia, they have a big argument, and he gets crazy with the nunnery bit. Exit Hamlet; enter back in Claudius and Polonius, talking about how mad Hamlet seemed because they absolutely heard him and Hamlet knew this. Then Polonius says:
How now, Ophelia? You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. So, they did hear it! In most all the previous scenes, and the ones after, Hamlet is very active; hes planning, plotting, getting things ready; hes already made some written contributions for the Theatre troupe thats preparing to perform for the Royal Court. Hes been pushing his plans forward to trap the King and give the final proof he needs to show that the King did in fact kill his father. Since seeing the ghost of his dead dad, hes been consumed by this desire for justice and revenge. Suddenly, for this 1 scene, he does a complete 180 degrees and finds it a good idea to kill himself? Yes, he contemplated it in the beginning, but keep in mind, that was BEFORE he found out his father was murdered. He didn't have any motivations as he does now. At that time, it was thought to be natural causes and the will of God, and hence, theres no one to get mad at, because no one did anything wrong. When the issue of murder comes up, that changes everything and revenge becomes his motive. Suicide is a non-solution. Its a passive thing to do compared to the rest of the events going on. Its the easy way out, and Hamlet has been setting up these plots and plays with Machiavellian precision, which is definitely not the easy way to do anything. One could claim this speech shows another side to the character of Hamlet, but would that do anything to move the story forward? On its own, it doesnt. The full text of this play can run upwards of 4 hours long. How many people will sit for a 4 hour movie when it has parts that go nowhere? Is this speech Shakespeares way of saying, Heres a bathroom break? It is NOT a soliloquy! Ophelia was on-stage. Claudius and Polonius are hiding, and listening in, and Hamlet knows it! That means his whole suicide speech is by design. Hes already spent a few scenes convincing people that hes gone mad, and there IS method in it. The King and crony are trying to figure out if its true. Now, hes actively deceiving them, so that would make this speech something that moves the plot forward. Its just another part of Hamlets master
plan, and so far, theyre falling right into it. More evidence: The last time we saw Hamlet on stage, he meets The Players, and asks the head player to give a short, impromptu performance, who readily obliges him. Then, everyone else ends up leaving the stage, leaving Hamlet, alone, for real this time. Here he has a real soliloquy (he even mentions hes all alone) whereupon he marvels at the performance that head player just gave. In fact, he realizes, and is very much ashamed at the fact, that the actor has just
shown more intensity and commitment in his task of that brief performance than Hamlet has in HIS task of avenging his fathers murder. Hamlet has just mentally smacked himself, reminding him to start raising the stakes, or hes going to fail at his task, and also realized the importance of acting as a role in his deceptions. So I'm supposed to believe that suddenly, the very next words he speaks on stage are implying the direct opposite? That he wants to kill himself? A soliloquy of his innermost thoughts that says he needs to step it up followed by another saying the complete opposite? Even MORE evidence: Shakespeares original source for Hamlet. This is NOT an original play by Shakespeare. It had been done previously by other playwrights and writers. The original source is called Historia Danica by Saxo Grammaticus. It chronicles the story of Prince Amlothi, also referred to as Amlethus. Pull off the u-s at the end, move the ""H"" to the front, and you have ""Hamlet."" The plot matches the play exactly. The father of Amlethus is murdered by his brother who then marries Amlethus mother, the Prince seeks revenge. A large part of his plan has to do with feigning madness. Two attempts are made to prove hes actually sane, one of which is to tempt him into lechery, the thinking being that any man who lusts for women cannot truly be insane. His uncle arranges for a woman to casually run into Amlethus in the forest to seduce him while they watch, which is the prototype scene for this Hamlet/Ophelia scene. But Amlethus is warned of the trap ahead of time, so he makes his own arrangements to whisk her off to a hidden place away from the eyes of the Kings agents, who gets her to tell him everything. He also has sex with her, because why wouldn't he? But in the view of the Kings agents, he continues his act of being batshit insane.

I'm in a Target parking lot with no clue what to do. Brief history: myself (25F) and my sister (22F) were raised by a pair of bipolar Ns who frequently switched between being and and Es. Both were on and off medication for mental health issues. I have always been fiercely protective of my younger sister, even though I was the SG and she was the GC and she didn't get picked on much. My parents would get violent but the second they raised a hand to my sister, I physically got in the way. Outwardly we were a great family - active in Girl Scouts and school stuff, super smart kids with a penchant for troublemaking, all very friendly, etc. Our parents worked in tandem - they'd egg each other on. We had many recoveries and relapses that therapy could not fix. Four and a half years ago my parents divorced and I moved in with the guy I'm about to marry. My parents are both still flaming Ns but I don't have to deal with them more than once a month (my mom) or three times a year (my dad, who replaced our family with a nearly-identical-to-us set of sisters and a single mother three hours away). Even after all that crap though, during my childhood my family was very close. We didn't have any cousins or anything so it was just us. We were poor most times and we stuck together, even if it was actually painful. I can't believe I fucking miss that. I miss my family. I miss my violent bipolar emotionally abusive mother and my aggressive opioid addicted father. I miss the good times - the camping trips between phases and the Disneyland days. Over the past four years I've held multiple jobs (nanny, personal assistant, cook, waitress, admin assistant, freelance artist, etc.) My current job is the longest I've ever held, at 9 months going on 10. I'm a nanny right now and I generally like what I do, even if my stress levels prevent me from being better at it. I live with my fianc in a tiny one bedroom apartment in the same city I grew up in. Nothing is changing for me. I don't want to go back to school, I don't want a desk job, I don't want to do anything. I feel like the constant encouragement then eventual tear down of any of my goals when I was younger has killed any dreams I've had. ("" I want to write for a magazine!"" My mom said. "" Except you'll be miserable and it's not a real job and it's too hard to get a job in that field"", she said.)

I had to apologize in person, despite the advice of my lawyers. ""Excuse me? Sorry... I..."" My tongue twisted. Maybe I should have written something down. But then, bizarrely, they both smiled and shook my hand. "" We know who you are. Thank you so much."" I was shocked. Even more, I was offended. What about the girl we'd just buried?

s_2544_1099,"THE MAN IN THE CHIMNEY I wake up 3:05am, I'm not sure what woke me up but considering I'm a light sleeper it could've been anything, I get up out of bed and walk to the door, I pause for a moment... silence, deafening silence, I look at the LED clock 3:07am, I open the door and walk around the house to make sure it's safe, Again, nothing. I walk to the sink and turn the faucet on to get a glass of water, nice cold water. After I finish drinking my water I set the cup down on counter and begin heading back to my room to get some sleep for work... but I hear a noise in the living room, Like a tapping, I try to ignore it but I know if I don't investigate I'll be up all night thinking about it, so I begin slowly trodding my way over to the living room, I notice that I can hear my own footsteps and breathing... it's so quiet wich is weird because, I have a cat who's quite active at night... I finally make it to the living room and don't see anything but hear the tapping again... I'm not sure what it is but I'm starting to get nervous that someone's In my house... I hear it again from my fireplace and quickly twirl around and see nothing... I hear something over in the far dark end of the room, I look and just see my cat sitting there, thank God. I head back in bed when, I feel something... my cats sleeping in my bed with me, I give him a pet and go to sleep. I wake up in the morning and see my cat and then... I remember when I saw my cat sitting at the otherside of the living room... that wasn't my cat... I saw my cat in my bed but never saw that thing exit the living room... I managed to build up the courage to get out of bed and investigate... nothing, except a faint tap in the fireplace but it's also raining so it might just be that, 5:30am I drive to work and sit at my cubicle, my boss comes in and says I gotta work late unfortunately because we're short staffed, but he'll pay me for the extra hours, I agree and he leaves. I sit there in the dark typing spreadsheet after spreadsheet when my screen blurs, someone must be behind me... I turn around and see nothing... The screen only blurs when someone is behind me, it's one of those privacy monitors that blur when they detect someone in close proximity that isn't you... I turn it off out of anxiety and go back to working trying to ignore it, I finally finish up and drive home, I get home and the first thing that greets me is a gentle tapping from the fireplace, I realize the tapping isn't as high up in the chimney as last night, as if the tappings gotten closer to the ground, I try to ignore it and go unwind at my desk for a bit before going to bed. I wake up, I hear the tapping has turned to banging. I sit there scared, I decide to grab my shotgun and head into the living room, I sit there ALL NIGHT shotgun in hand listening to this banging and occasional animalistic breathing... I feel like I'm starting to lose my grip on reality, like I'm going insane, i hasn't been sleeping much and it's starting to take its toll. Night turns to day and the tapping stops, for now. I'm losing it I'm losing I'm losing it. I try to sit down in my room and watch TV to forget about this but I keep seeing things in my peripherals, I keep hearing things, I keep smelling things, I can't shake it, I can literally feel my mind descending into a horrific and nauseous downspiral of insanity and terror, I feel like a rat trapped in an infinite maze of mirrors, my world is spinning. I desperately need sleep but every single fucking time that 'thing' taps and bangs, I fear if i sleep it will come out of the fireplace and decorate my room in my remains, my world is spinning, I'm going to try to sleep tonight. 2:17am I wake up and hear another tapping and I cry, i grab a flashlight and frustratingly stomp over to the fire place and pause for a moment, paranoid that I might see some demented creature or serial killer hiding in my chimney when the Tapping interrupts my thoughts and I quickly turn the flashlight on making an audible click and peak up the chimney... something very swiftly scurries out of the chimney, possibly a racoon, but no eldritch abomination, and no serial killer. I laugh at the absurdity of the situation, or more of a nervous chuckle, and get ready and go back to bed 2:23am same fucking night as the above paragraph I wake up again, fucking annoyed and tired but fearful for my life to yet again another tapping noise, even louder. I get out of bed and grab my flashlight ""again"" and anxiously walk into the living room and shine it at the fireplace... I see two hands shoot up as if something tugged on them, that's it, thats the last straw... I saw those hands clear as day, two charred hands with 5 jointed long fingers... I tumble back and panic. I try to calm myself down and tell myself it was my imagination and that I'm just being paranoid, but I can't fucking forget how clear I saw them. After an eternity of weighing my options and telling myself that its a result of severe lack of sleep i finally walk back to bed and I make a reminder on my phone to call someone to check the chimney, a dick move to be roping someone else in but I desperately need to know if this is real or if I'm losing my fucking mind. I wake up the next day, it's Saturday so no work, I get out of bed and get dressed for when the guy comes to investigate the ""mysterious tapping noise"" i decide to go to the store and buy battery powered cameras while I wait, while I'm at the store I swear I see my cat with dead pale eyes and matted fur staring at me just out of my peripherals. I get home and install them and set them up to my phone, I then take my cat and drive to my friend's house. I explain my situation and he agrees to let me hang out for the day, we play video games and my cat is awfully still... I remember that guy I called so I take my cat and drive home just in time, me and the guy named David enter the house and I see ash on the floor David sees it to, I tell him about the tapping, he tells me about how there have other reports of tapping in there windows and to not worry about it. He also said the ash on floor is a bit unusual especially considering there's footprints and paw prints In it. He leaves and I watch him drive away. I sweep up the ash and remembered the cameras, I sit at my desk wich is against the wall opposite of the chimney with my monitor facing the chimney, i try my absolute best to avoid falling asleep, I look at the footage and I watch and see as soon as I leave the house a long emaciated charred creature crawls out of the fireplace and stands 5 feet infront of the chimney standing at 8ft tall in pin straight posture it's so emaciated I can see it's ribs... it has split jaws and 3 big black eyes, like smooth black pearls, it has four arms, two normal ones and 2 long rope like arms that lay curled on the floor, I also see my cat again, same dead eyes and matted fur... I fast forward and it just stands perfectly still and petrified the ENTIRE DAY, let me emphasize this *thing* crawled out of my fireplace, the one I'm sitting in the same room as and it stood perfectly still for TEN HOURS,not a peep, and not a single movement, I hear my car door slam shut in the footage and the creature walks backwards crawling back up the chimney dragging its long rope like hands with it before disappearing up the chimney, the cat seems to crawl away behind my desk... the footage ends. I sit in shock trying to process this... I drive over to a friend's house and explain, he's hesitant but I convince him to let me sleep atleast one night at his house He relents. That night I had the absolute worst nightmare known to man I wake up but... in a dream, I think... I look around and my house is twisted and warped, I can't fucking stand to look at this house anymore but its definitely a dream... I hear tapping, I'm confused for a second but then remember my predicament, it taps again, like it's trying to lure me to the chimney, I get up and the cat right fucking there stares at me with an infinite gaze and the intensity of a black hole I jump back, I look to the fireplace wich is now three times bigger and hear knocking, knock knock knock then a long pause, I hear the knocking again but more aggressive like if the FBI where busting my door down, I yell that I'm armed, I yell like a rat that's been cornered in a maze, a rat that won't ever see the light of day again, a rat that's locked in a cage with its own deteriorating mind, I hear clicking like it's using echo location mixed in with choking and insect like chittering, I want to wake up but I can't... it sounds like the clicker from last of us ... I slowly look behind me and see two hands slowly lower from the chimney... the... second chimney? they grip the top of the fireplace, it's long 5 jointed fingers gripping it and I hear banging as it stomps down the chimney, I see 3 glints in triangular formation wich must be its eyes, i see it drop into the fireplace and crawl out, dragging its long rope like arms behind it... I get down on the ground confused and nauseous all the while it screeches at me sticking it's long shiny black tongue out at me... it launches it's rope arms with its twisted 5 jointed fingers at me like a grapling hook, it begins walking backwards... into the fireplace like it did before, it's grip so tight I can hear my bones begin to crack, I try to fight and resist, kicking and screaming, this is it, this is the end, I look at my cat, it stares at me with dead eyes... I feel the grip getting tighter and tighter like a vice as it pulls me up the chimney is this even a dream, I wonder if I'm half dreaming half awake or if this is some kind of sick mind trick, I wake up covered in a cold sweat... I'm at my friend's house and then remember he let me spend the night. I get out of bed, I get dressed, I eat breakfast, I drive home much more calm after sleeping, albeit with a horrific nightmare but I slept nonetheless. I make it to my front door and stand there trembling. I don't want to go back, but maybe now that I'm not sleep deprived it will be fine, maybe David was right it was just an animal and I was just really tired I enter the house and close the door. I walk around a bit inspecting, everything seems good, I don't see a dead cat staring at me wich is a good sign... I also don't see my regular cat anywhere. I suddenly fear that dead cat that keeps watching me IS my regular cat but I shake that thought away, I figure he just got outside again and I put food out for him. I walk over to the chimney... I grab my flashlight... I brace myself... nothing, just a normal chimney... David was right, I walk around and see my regular cat sleeping on the floor in the kitchen, I look at him a bit longer to confirm its not a demented trick, nope it's just my cat. I go over to the fridge and hear something groan somewhere in my house. I silently shut the fridge and here it groan again... the groaning quickly turn to erratic screaming and clicking. I grab my cat and put him outside where it's safer and when I close the door I see the dead cat again, I slowly walk around it and it doesn't even move to watch me... I sprint for the shotgun and trip and hit my head on a wall corner, I tripped over the dead cat. My vision blurs And the reality of my situation sets back in... I did sleep and I did dream about being dragged up the chimney, I can confirm that that was a dream, but the creature is still real... very real. I feel like iv been fading in and out of consciousness from sleep deprivation again even though I had a full 8hours sleep. I feel like the line between reality and dream has been blurred, It's like this house has been marked by something eldritch in origin, iv been seeing things now and hearing things but I don't want to believe it's real, I stumble to my room with a splitting headach and lock the door, the cats sitting on a shelf staring down at me eyes like spotlights, it's gaze burns holes through me it's so intense, I hear a tapping in the chimney... I listen and hear the tapping turn to banging and screaming, loud loud unholy screaming, like a million voices crying from the gates of hell, I listen as something crawls out of the fireplace, I listen as it screams and I listen as something smaller scurries about, I leave the room and run to the garage and into the attic and bring the ladder back up and see the cat right there I crawl back in fear to the other end of the attic, I have 1 shot left and I'm considering something that I can't undo. Iv been sitting in the attic for what feels like forever I can feel sleep trying to take over again, I feel like the cats giving out my hiding spot to the man in the chimney, I can hear whispers in my head saying to end it, I think they might be right, a quick and painless death is far better then being violently dragged up a chimney kicking and screaming, but I refuse to listen, I try to tell myself I'll make it, surly a pump action to the head will take care of it, if I can even aim.

s_897_1238,"Attempted sex abuser keeps trying to come back in to my life. This may be long. I am a successful 30yo male engineer. I've lived on my own since I was 16 - my parents and I get along ok so long as we aren't under the same roof. I'll come out and say it - I'm smarter than them. Or, at the very least I research my decisions before making them and back them up with said research. I was a straight A student. Racked up tons of community service, was active in a church youth group. I led several student groups. I won congressional good citizenship awards. I was never in trouble. I just asked questions and wanted good answers. So, when I lived with them, I would point out things that didn't make sense. that maybe a gigantic steak with mashed potatoes, a big helping of cake, and soda wasn't always the best dietary decision for each person. I am the only person in the family without diabetes now. I would point out that if they have to take a 3rd mortgage out on their home, maybe giving 500 dollars to charity isn't the wisest choice. They are almost 70 and still about 80k in debt, whereas I have all of my loans paid off save for a mortgage and one private student loan (in total, less than 2 years salary for me). I'd point out that if their church is pressuring them to fork over mortgage money, maybe it's time for a new church. They'd take me wanting to make myself a healthy soup for dinner instead of having the same calorie-ladened food as them and I'd get screamed at for hours as ""unappreciative."" By the time I graduated high school I weighed nearly 350 pounds (""you don't get up from this table until you've cleaned that plate!""). I'm doing well, not because of them, but in spite of them. I know this sounds arrogant, and maybe it is. But so far everything we've had it out on when I was a teenager has worked out well. Back then though, any time I'd point out logical flaws or fallacies, or try to improve things for myself, they took it as me being ""ungrateful."" So, to ""teach me a lesson"" they decided to send me to a family friend for some ""tough love"" for a summer. I never went back home. The first week was great. He had been someone I looked up to. He was a decorated retired soldier that I thought would understand that my parents are a bit off kilter and prone to making bad decisions and hyperbole. We talked about it a lot the first week. He actively asked me about the issues I was having at home. Then one night while I am sleeping, I get slapped. It was him with a steel baseball bat, standing over me. He told me I was his for the summer, and he was going to teach me how good I had it ""back home."" So began a summer of physical, emotional, and mental abuse. He'd force me to work outside for hours with no sunscreen (""what are you, a little bitch? Man up, you dont need sunscreen."") which led to my shoulders blistering, cracking, bleeding. I still have those physical scars. That put me in the hospital for heat stroke. He beat me several times for whatever perceived slight he could conjure up. He said he had people spying on me, and claimed I destroyed his pool by pouring bleach into it because ""one of his spies saw it."" ( I had had 2 people over that night and we were inside the whole time, so no, it was not me who touched his pool). I got a summer job and begged to stay there for extra hours, but when I got a paycheck he threatened to beat me if I didn't sign it over to him. He refused to feed me, and said I had to pay for my own food. I lost nearly 40 pounds that summer from stress and lack of food. The only things I ate were free food at my workplace (a pretzel place in a walmart that had an ""employees can help themselves"" policy - i literally lived on pretzel dogs and pretzels for the summer). I begged my parents to take me home but they were the ones who put me there. He busted my nose. My parents kept telling me ""it's not that bad. You WANTED a vacation from home, right?"" But the worst was one night after a day of work, I came home and he forced me to sit down next to him on the couch. He turned on a porno. I have no idea if this was genuine or if it was just more mental abuse. He started talking about how when he was in the military he participated in an orgy and it was the most sexually thrilling moment of his life. He hands me some tissues and tells me to jerk off for him. I say no, that I'm uncomfortable. He keeps saying it's ok, if I jerk off he will too, I keep saying no, no, no. He keeps pressuring me. He starts throwing tissues at me and telling me to whip it out. I get up and run out of the house and sprint as fast as I can down the nearby highway. Police are called and pick me up, I tell them I want to go home. Police listen to my parents, and take me back to abuser's house ""because they want to teach me a lesson and scare me straight."" He proceeds to beat the shit out of me, threatens me with the bat that he'll bash my skull in if I ever try that again, etc. Finally summer ends, and my parents take me back home. I contact my best friend and move out immediately. I leave everything behind. I just want out of my parents house. I sever all ties with the abuser. He severs ties with my family for the most part. I am on poor terms with my family, I see them maybe 1 day a year. I never talked to them about everything that happened other than the fact that when I needed them, they weren't there for me and refused to help me or believe me. They keep saying it was for my own good. Fast forward to a year ago. I get a message from the abuser in facebook. I ignore it. I get another, and I ignore it. I get a friend request. I get another. I ignore it. Then I get a call from my mom asking me why I won't talk to the abuser. It turns out that my parents, who are both very sick (mom in a wheelchair, dad in and out of the hospital) have been getting tons of help from the abuser for free. He put a roof on their house. He repaired their sidewalks, etc. They view him as a son. I like that they're getting free things out of the asshole. So long as I don't have to see or hear from him or hear ABOUT him, I'm content. I tell her to stop trying to force it. I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to see him. My mom keeps trying to set up days for me to come over to the house when he just so happens to be there. I turn around, grab my wife, get in my car, and drive away. Finally I told the abuser point blank that I have no desire to ever speak to him. To leave me alone. Stay the hell out of my life. Yesterday my wife had to drop by my parent's house to grab a phone charger for my dad who was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. While there, my mom tells my wife that they my father had asked the abuser to ""give me a rough summer to see how good I had it at home."" my dad wants to talk to me about it. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to destroy the guys life. He had it rough (mom shot herself with a shotgun, dad was an abusive alcoholic and ultimately killed himself). He has kids. He does help my parents. I am content to have no contact with him. My parents just won't drop it. Maybe the jerkoff thing was some fucked up mind game. I'm not broken, I've done very well for myself. I'm paranoid of people and an introvert, but I've always been that way. It's when he reaches out to me and pushes the issue, then I want blood. I also am concerned about my nephews who live with my parents. What if it wasn't a mind game? Maybe he'll try the same thing with my nephews? Would my parents even believe me if I said something? They have a very strong penchant for denial about bad things in their life. And now here I am. Asking you all for your advice. I want this person out of my life. He so far has respected my wishes to leave me the hell alone, but he bitches to my parents and they pressure me to talk to him. I just want it to go away. I just don't know what to do.

s_2953_602,"OP's Mom cheats on his step-dad and ruins his and his sisters' lives. Spoiler: gt;!This is a tragic update! lt; Trigger Warning: gt;!Suicide! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/ThrowRAihatemymom](<URL>) **Mom(40F) cheated on Step-Dad(45M) and ruined my(16M) and my siblings' lives** I am a 16 years old male. I have 2 sisters (10F,8F). Our biological father was never in our lives. He left my mom when she was pregnant with me, came back 6 years later and said he wanted to make amends and that we could be a happy family. Somehow my mom immediately started saying that she loved him but he left after mom got pregnant again. Then 2 years later he came back, I cried and begged my mom to not let him into our lives because I hated him. Well, he said the same thing, my mom also said she loved him and then he left after she got pregnant again. My mom was a waitress so the 4 of us lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I was essentially another parent to my sisters because mom was always working. Sometimes, we wouldn't eat breakfast or dinner because we couldn't afford it. Other times, I did not eat anything so that my sisters could eat. My mom met another man (45M) a year after my youngest sister was born. He is a really good man. His wife and daughter had died in an accident a long time ago when he was in his 20s. He met my mom when he was ready to date again. He is a really good man and treated us like his own children and I consider him my father. He was very wealthy and owned multiple businesses. We eventually moved into his huge mansion like house. I also had a better school there. We 3 siblings got our own rooms and I got better clothes, played video games for the first time in my life and a bunch of other things. He taught me things, helped me catch up in school because I could not do well in the previous school. He spent a lot of time with the 3 of us. My sisters eventually started calling him ""dad"". I followed shortly after. I remember him crying, hugging us and telling he loved us when we called him dad for the first time. They eventually got married and dad asked me to be one of his groomsmen and of course, I said yes while my sister were my mom's bridesmaids. Mom stayed at home to take care of us. As far as I know, they were very happy together. They went on dates at least once in 2 weeks, kissed each other frequently and always told each other that they loved each other. He also knew about mom's past and realized she had issues and got her into counselling. I was really happy that my mom had finally found someone who treated her well. I was also very happy for myself and my siblings and really loved him. He also said that he would pay for college for the 3 of us. My dream is to become a doctor and I never thought it would be possible cause it was so expensive so and I was so freaking happy. Mom also told me she was very lucky to have found him and that she loves him and is very grateful of how he has made her and our lives better. Well, last year July dad discovered that my mom was having an affair with his best friend who was also the best man at their wedding. Apparently, the affair was going on for a long time, I do not know exactly how long. Mom cried and begged him to give her another chance. He didn't, understandably. He let us keep all the new things such as clothes for me and toys for my sisters. When I went to him crying and asking him why he was leaving us he just hugged me and told me about mom's affair. He said the affair is too painful and that he cannot be in this marriage anymore and then said that he loved me and my sisters. My sisters do not know about the affair, I do not think they will understand. He got a prenup so mom did not get anything that wasn't hers. Dad just had to pay the rent of a new apartment until the divorce was finalized. We stayed in a decent apartment but after the divorce was done we moved into a much smaller apartment. I tried to be in contact with him but it does not seem like he wants a relationship with me. He has never responded to my messages. I sent a final letter to him last year December thanking him for everything he did for me and my sisters and that I loved him and would remember him forever. So now we're back to a one bedroom apartment, skipping meals and barely being able to afford anything. I sleep on the floor now. My sisters share a bed while my mom uses another. Mom is a waitress again. I've also taken a part time at a grocery store to help with money. I just hate my mom so much right now. I only took the job to help my sisters. I have also stopped talking to mom. Recently she came crying to me and told me that she was sorry for ruining everything and she wanted me to talk to her. I broke down and just said ""I don't understand. Why did you cheat on him? He was taking such good care of you and the 3 of us. He was also gonna send us to college. For the first time in my life, I was happy. You have destroyed my life. Why do you always have to ruin everything? You already did that twice when you let \[bio father\] back in my life. I hate you. I never want to talk to you again"" She was crying a lot after I said that. I am gonna admit, what I said was pretty rude but at that time I was just so angry. I just hate her so much right now. I just wish she dies a very painful death. These thoughts are the only things in my head. It's making me go insane and I know it's not normal. I read online that therapy would be useful but we can't even afford food on most days so we don't have insurance. All I can think about is how she ruined everything. He didn't even ask for much. Mom was living such a luxurious life and was just at home taking care of her own biological children. I just miss him so much. Even my sisters keep asking when they are going back home or when they'll see dad again. They've also started crying and asking for dad a lot of times this past year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so frustrated and just angry at everything. I wish I could run from here but if I did who would take care of my siblings. That stupid mother can't do shit. I guess I'm here cause I need some help. I don't really know what to do. Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything. Other days I just wished I died and all of this ended. [UPDATE](<URL>) **My Mom(40F) Committed Suicide Because Of Me(16M)** Hello everybody. This is a throwaway account. About 2 weeks ago, I found my mom dead in our house. She had sent my siblings (10F,9F) to their friend's house and then hung herself. She really changed after she got divorced from my step dad after she cheated on him (I made a post about it recently). My mom and I didn't talk a lot after that. One of the last things I told her was that I hated her and asked her why she ruined my and my sisters' lives. I wish I didn't say that. Maybe she would have been alive if I supported her. I have had no contact with my step dad after the divorce. My sisters and I live with my mom's sister and her husband now. We never met them before this and even my mom never had contact with them but they are the only family that could be found and they agreed to let us live with them. My siblings and I don't like living here. Both of them are constantly shouting at each other and at us. We're just so uncomfortable here. I don't think they can afford food for all of us. I have a job at a grocery store so I mostly buy food for my siblings. My boss is also very nice and allows me to take home some extra things for free. I really miss my mom. My sisters are also always crying for her. She had her flaws but I still love her. She's my mom. The last thing I told her was that I hated her. I just wish that I told her that I love her and supported and helped her. Then she would've been alive today. What I told her tipped her over the edge. I can't do any of this anymore. I just don't know anything anymore.",A.1,True,0,1,[],"[(-1, -1)]",,
s_2815_1660,"Comfort Food My wife lost her battle with bone cancer a year ago. I have no one. Ive worked from home for the last six months. My employer has been sympathetic and accommodating after everything that happened. Too many workplaces neglect and end up getting rid of disabled employees. I guess I should feel valued. Breakfast was mac and cheese left over from the night before. I hadnt made enough for my breakfast to be even remotely satisfying. Stock prices and quantitative analytics spilled from my computer monitors as I tried to concentrate on work. My eyes kept drifting over to the picture of me and Brynn on our wedding day. I have no attention span when Im hungry. I groaned as I lifted myself into a standing position. My knees were shot. I made my way over to the kitchen pantry and got a bag of chips and a bottle of soda. Coughing as I trundled across the office over to my desk, Id already opened the chips and was pushing them into my mouth. As I walked by and saw my reflection in the glossy murk of my hibernating television, I could swear I saw Brynn standing by my side. When I blinked, she was gone. Just like a year ago. By lunchtime I was just finishing the chips and the bottle of soda. I was ravenous. My concentration had improved somewhat as I ate, and I made a few good trades that got my company some cash and me a nice commission or two. But it was noon. The market volume was drying up as everyone went to lunch. Id start working again around two and go hard until closing bell. Until then, I had to eat something. The pizza delivery guy always brings me extra stuff because Im a generous tipper. At this point in my career, I earn more money than I know what to do with, so why not spread it around? I ordered two large Sicilian pizzas, some mozzarella sticks, garlic knots, and chicken alfredo. The delivery guy brought me a pint of ice cream and a cannoli. He got a $100 tip. I think my interaction with him is some of the only person-to-person contact I have nowadays. I sat in front of the TV as I ate. I didnt bother to turn it on. When I looked up after finishing my first pizza, Brynns reflection was watching me. Her body was distorted by the curved surface of the television. She was shorter. Heavier looking. Compressed. She moved her arms as if to embrace me. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to regain my composure. I had to be hallucinating. The lids of my eyes lifted to the sight of her face inches from mine. My scream reverberated throughout my cavernous office space. Before Id finished my yell, shed wrapped her arms around me and nestled her head against my shoulder. Everything went white. All I can remember from that moment was blissful warmth and closeness. I can only describe it as reexperiencing the minute I knew I was in love with her, along with all the associated tactile sensations of the most intimate embrace Id ever felt. The experience couldnt have lasted more than two seconds. When it was over, it was as if every organ had been ripped from my body and Id been left to exsanguinate on the floor. A feeling of overwhelming emptiness swept over me like an atomic inferno. My mourning period following Brynns death was nothing compared to this. I was a bottomless pit of despair and loneliness. The expanse of my lunch was still spread in front of me. Mindlessly, I began eating. Every swallow felt like an eyedropper of water attempting to refill an evaporated oceanscape. But it was progress. I ate until nothing was left. My stomach ached, protesting the amount of food it had been forced to accommodate in such a short period of time. But the hunger remained. The emptiness remained. And it taunted me. I tried to get on with my day. Work was out of the question. There wasnt much food in my house, so Id started drinking soda. I definitely had enough of that. One of my closets had countless three-liter bottles of the generic brand I preferred over the popular ones. Id gone through two of them before I started feeling lightheaded. I couldnt begin to imagine what this was doing to my already-unhealthy blood sugar. That was the least of my concerns. Around 8pm I walked out of my house for the first time in almost a month. Everything had been delivered to me over that period of time. Hoping there was still gas in my X5, I clambered up into the drivers seat. I was shocked at how much bigger Id gotten since I last drove and felt my only moment of relief all day when I discovered the seat could go back another few inches. The car started with no effort and I began driving to the store. I was in no condition to drive. My vision kept blurring and despite the tremendous pain of emptiness I felt, I desperately wanted to go to sleep. I managed to keep my composure, however, and made it to my destination. Even with the handicap tags on my truck, the short walk from it to the store felt like torture. I was wheezing by the time Id taken my cart and started pushing it around the front of the store. There was no way Id use one of the motorized scooters they provide. I dont have much pride left, but I still have enough to keep walking until I simply cant anymore. I bought whatever was closest to the doors and the cash registers. I didnt care what. I had a bagboy help me load up my car with the three carriages-worth of food Id purchased. The gratitude I felt for him and his colleague as they pushed and emptied the carts was immeasurable and I emptied my wallet of cash to thank them. I went home. My entire trip was spent eating. When I got back I turned off the car and sat in the dark, illuminated only by the dim light of my garage. I frantically worked to tear away wrapping and packaging. Sleeves of crackers disappeared down my throat. Partially-frozen TV dinners of meatloaf and mashed potatoes followed. I sobbed as I pushed it all into my mouth, hacking and coughing crumbs onto my steering wheel and dashboard. Only when my stomach pain was nearly unbearable did my feeling of emptiness dip to a level where I had the strength to get out of the garage. It took nearly an hour to empty my car of the colossal amount of food Id purchased. I crashed onto my couch, gasping for air as stars twirled before my eyes. A few minutes later, after Id regained some semblance of wherewithal, I felt an acute pain in my right shoulder. When I reached around with my left hand to investigate, I yelped as I sliced into my index finger. Some asshole had left a juice glass on the arm of the couch and it had fallen off onto the cushion. That same asshole recently fell onto that couch without looking and shattered the glass with his shoulder. I went into the bathroom. A familiar, morbidly-obese man greeted me in my full-length mirror. I turned to look at the damage to my shoulder. Chunks of glass were embedded in my shirt and skin underneath. Despite my disgust with myself and the pain in my shoulder and stomach and finger, I felt slightly better and less empty. Sighing, I pulled off my shirt and felt shards of glass detach from my shoulder and plink onto the ground. The feeling of emptiness reemerged like the head of a hydra. I began to cry. I stared into the mirror at my shirtless self, watching the blood trickle from my shoulder in thin rivulets which were stopped by the absorbent waistband of my sweatpants. I wrapped my arms around my body in desperation. The cheap facsimile of an embrace only served to make me sob harder. I released the hold and started plucking the remaining glass from my shoulder. Each removed shard made the feeling of empty loneliness intensify. The feeling became overwhelming when I pulled out the last piece. I stared at the shard through my tears with curiosity. Then, without a hint of critical thought, I pushed the shard back into my shoulder. A tiny fraction of my emptiness evaporated. A fraction comparable to an entire stomach-full of food. Time seemed to freeze as I methodically broke the larger shards of glass Id removed from my shoulder into hairpin-sized needles. I carefully plunged them into my skin. By the time Id finished with the glass, there was a semicircle of crystalline splinters decorating my upper arm. Warmth radiated out from the shards and suffused through the surrounding skin. The pain was miniscule compared to the emptiness the glass had helped eliminate. With more energy than Id been able to muster since my experience with my wifes apparition this afternoon, I hurried to my office to find my stapler. I assumed I was losing my mind. A healthy person doesnt see his dead wife. A healthy person doesnt ameliorate emptiness through food and glass. But what I felt was real to me. It was as real as the floor on which I stood and as real as the air filling my lungs as I gasped with the tiny pinpricks of relief I felt as each staple entered my arm. I emptied the stapler into myself, refilled it four times, and was left looking for something new to use. I went to the garage and over to Brynns work area. She would frame pictures and paintings for her friends and family and even set up an Etsy shop before her diagnosis. Everything was right where shed left it. An hour went by as I pushed tiny, sharp framing nails into my other arm. These hurt much more than the glass or the staples. I arranged them in a tight, sleeve-like grid. Pain radiated throughout the limb, but I persisted. A few times, when I blinked, I saw Brynn. Right now, its the morning after the events Ive described. I havent slept. My night was spent finding ways to fill that void inside me. Up to this point, Ive been successful. Every part of me hurts, though. Everything, from the top of my head to the bottoms of my feet, is covered; punctured and impaled in some way. Most of it is broken glass from the various glasses and china sets in the kitchen. Some of it is from my wifes old sewing box. Each of my fingertips have long pins originating right underneath the nail and terminating somewhere up toward the knuckles in my hands. Its hard to type with straight fingers. Im standing at my computer desk because my back and buttocks are caked with broken glass and the pain is too intense when I sit down. Even though the bottoms of my feet are equally encrusted, I have less sensation in them because of my underlying medical conditions. When I walk, I can feel the thicker and longer chunks of glass carving at the bone. The part I find most difficult to deal with are the series of thumbtacks in my soft palate. They are constantly causing me agonizing discomfort and they itch just as much as they hurt. I cant help but to trace my tongue around them which just draws my attention to their presence even more. The constant, caustic undulations of searing pain are only tempered by brief, infinitesimally-soft brushes of warmth. I know its my wife trying to touch me again. But the feeling of emptiness within me is still there, albeit far less intense than yesterday. Ignoring it just makes it worse. I have to keep going, but I dont have any space left. I know what Im going to do next, and probably finally, and thats okay. In a few minutes, Ill be slashing open my belly and thighs and arms and stuffing them with the entire pantrys-worth of our splintered wedding china. I cant live with this feeling of emptiness. If doing this is what it takes to give me some relief and peace of mind and body, its what needs to happen. I have the knife honed and ready. As I write this, I know with 100% certainty Im not in my right mind. Ive long since stopped caring. And with that, Im going to go now.

s_2180_5,"Vent Post: Process of Looking for Apartments/Moving Out, Fear, Doubts, Setbacks, ""Good Faith Deposits,"" Intuition vs. Paranoia I have another vent, been stressing, doing research all night and didn't get any sleep (not that I am tired). Quick Background:
- Horrible Soul crushing living situation that brings me pain/fear all the time. - Unemployed but have savings to last a couple of months if I find a place. Not looking for a job until I find and have a stable place. - Been looking for sublet Craigslist apartments for months on months, as far back as March/April. It's been so long because I haven't been full-time/all the time. I've also been looking for sublets (between 2-6 months), somewhere I can clear my head, collect myself, get a job, save money, and eventually find more stable/longer term place. Lastly it's taken so long mostly because of fear/anxiety. Just looking at Craigslist housing posts used to cause stomach-aches. It still does but less and I know that I need to get out/have my own space. My situation:
I found a place on Craigslist a week ago. I spoke to someone and went to see the place on Tuesday. There were 2 other people looking for the place too. BTW that took strength, I was soo afraid. My stomach hurt and I was nervous. Thank God my mom was there in case I had a panic attack. Anyway I like the place and I want it. The leasing manager/who is also an individual broker said if I want to continue forward with the process I have to do an application online. She emailed me the instructions and the application link. I filled out the application and submitted the required documents (I did everything online the same night). BUT THERE IS A CATCH. I must send a $500 deposit/closing fee to hold the apartment. In turn she will take it off the market. If I am approved then we will continue the process. I am assuming that means (getting/signing a lease). If I am not approved she will return the deposit back to me. Keep in mind that I haven't been approved, haven't seen or signed a lease, and I haven't met the landlords/homeowners. Even so, I have am having serious fear, doubts about this ""Good Faith Deposit"" process. I am afraid as soon as I put in the deposit she is going to run off with my money and I won't have any way of tracking her. As I already said I am unemployed but I do have savings and good credit. I have enough savings to last the whole 6 months of the leasing term. Even so, I am not loose or risky with my money. My family has always been struggling with money my entire life and I don't want to make mistakes and do stupid things with my hard earned money. I also have a cautious/plan everything nature. I did mad research. I looked up her name on the state department, I looked up the landlord/house owners property records. Everything seems legit. I looked up housing policies and it isn't unusual or illegal to do ask people for a holding or ""Good Faith Deposit"" before getting approved, looking at and signing a lease and meeting the landlords/property owners. I really don't want to be duped. I can't afford to fall for a scam. I really don't want this to be a scam. $500 is a lot to lose for someone who doesn't have a job, and has hang ups about spending money. I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it. Right now I am waiting to hear back from the leasing manager. I sent her an email with a bunch of questions (such as asking for an electric copy of the lease and getting this ""Good Faith Deposit"" thing in writing with signatures) and I may meet up with her to see the place again later on today. In the meantime while waiting I am freaking out. I don't want to lose out on this place but I also don't want to be scammed/made a fool of. All this fear makes me question if this is my intuition talking or my paranoia. Part me wants to just pay the deposit and see what happens and the other part is like no bitch (like what if I get stuck in a bad leasing situation). Like what should I do? How can I assure myself? How can I have faith?",A.4,False,0,0,[],[],,
s_384_11,"My diet now consists mostly of whole foods, I really try to limit processed foods(minus protein shakes and bars), but its nearly impossible to avoid all together. I eat a lot of chicken and turkey, broccoli, spinach salads and potatoes. Sounds pretty boring but changing up how you cook everything helps! Also season EVERYTHING it makes eating much more enjoyable. I drink a protein shake every morning, usually with half an english muffin. It has definitely taken some getting used to, I would recommend baby steps! Eat like usual, but put more veggies on your plate. Drink water instead of pop. Crystal light and Mio really helped me start drinking water. Herbal tea and water are all I drink. I aim to get 3-5L of water per day. It gets easier as you continue, and making tiny changes is sooooooo much easier than completely changing overnight. I didn't exercise for the first year and I dropped 100lbs. This summer I started doing yoga and HIIT cardio on the elliptical (increasing the resistance for short periods of time). I started doing yoga, body weight exercises and lifting free weights as well. I work out at home, no gym membership! Youtube is AWESOME for workout ideas. Christina Carlyle, Blogilates, Yoga with Adrienne are all great channels to check out! I've recently started running and I'm training for my first 5K coming up! I like keeping my workouts varied, I get bored easily. I aim to workout for at least 30mins 4-6 times a week. I find things I enjoy and do those! I never stick with exercise that I hate. Excess skin is a thing. Its not fun, but it's definitely better than having the fat! My whole body is a mess tbh.

s_1404_102,"Asking advice in a more detailed and extensive post. Read everything before commenting. Most advices simply don't work for me. Most advices don't work for me. Trust me, I have had so many advices, I tried so much. Doesnt work for me. So read everything before posting I'm a 21 year old guy, still studying, 1,85 / 6'0 tall, average looking, bad social skills. I'm not specifically looking for introvert women, but I do have a problem with overly extravert women. Like, those who talk to strangers for no more reason than ""small talk"". I dont know why, it just annoys me alot. Can't be my girlfriend I prefer the quiet ones. 6 reasons why I can't get a girlfriend or even a date or a female friend 1. the combination of being introvert and having ASD and being a weirdo, has made my social skills horrible. Because of my ASD I can never be socially skilled as normal people. It will never be natural to me even if I practise so much. I think women can always smell that something is different about me and that I'm not condifent in socially challenging situations. Online dating doesn't work for me. I'm not ugly but I guess I'm not attractive enough for women. I don't get swiped right on. And if I rarely get a match, I end up being ghosted although I never send any creepy or needy or sexual messages. I do have conversations with women, but 90% of the time a woman I meet is not what I'm looking for, so there it ends. Even in places of my interests. When I have conversations with women, that is always in places where we are both part of the same group of people. And 10% of them women who I like, even if its only a little bit (I'm open minded and not picky so thats not the problem) I have no idea how to take the next step in asking her out privately. I mean to meet when the group does not. I have never had a date and I have no idea where, when and how to ask a woman out for a date. I have no idea in which places and times it is appropriate or not to ask a woman out. + my social skills will mess it up if I even try to ask a woman out. Because of my depression (yes I really got diagnosed) I have less interest in everything. I have no real hobbies. I spend my days gaming and browsing the internet. I'm very open minded to go outside and do fun things together with a woman, but as long as I'm alone I really have nothing to do outside. You can say I'm a pretty boring person. Trust me, I tried different hobbies, it's just not for me. I'm not interested in anything. I can't enjoy anything in life. I tried, really. I'm willing to go outside and try hobbies with a woman but the problem is that right now I have not much to talk about on dating apps and maybe on a first date. I strongly prefer introverted women because 1. they are my type and 2. their social skills will probably not be good enough to smell that i'm not confident and socially skilled. Problem is that I have no idea where to find introverted women. Every time I go out, I only meet women who are overly extraverted and obviously not my type. They are too different from me. I know that introvert women are probably at home as much as I am, so I don't know how to get in contact with them... Yeah online dating, but those shitty apps like tinder have proven to not work at all for me. Not at all. So what have I tried and what am I still trying? I tried about 10 different dating apps and they all gave me no dates. I decided to stop wasting my time on these dati- ehh i mean swiping apps. Yeah because all I can do there is swiping. Not dating. I'm still trying to be social and make friends but my social skills mess it up every time. I tried improving my social skills for many years already but being social will never be natural and easy for me. I go outside, I meet with strangers, I talk with them, I approach women if they look even the slightest attractive, I just don't know how to go from a conversation to having her number or asking her on a date outside of the place where I met her. I also don't know what to talk about since I don't really have hobbies. The problem is not that I have no hobbies, because Im willing to try any hobbies for a girl. Its just that I dont know what to talk about. Dating apps will not work for me. I get 0 likes, 0 matches and if i get one I will be ghosted soon. My social circle, my friends, no. There are no nice women of my age in my social circle. University, I don't like anyone in my class, so I will HAVE TO approach strangers. Which I can't because my social skills are terrible and they can smell it. Make female friends without the intention of a relationship?

s_2815_1455,"Little Cows About ten years ago, I dated a masseuse named Valerie. Well, masseuse in training. She was passionate and enthusiastic and she practiced as frequently as she could. That meant I got a ton of free massages. Obviously, since we were a couple, those massages would escalate and turn into that usual thing couples do, but it was only after she felt shed gotten in a good practice session. After one of our, ahem, sessions, Val looked a little confused but also relieved. I asked her what was up. She told me the sores she had on the inside of her mouth didnt hurt anymore. Wed talked about those things before. She said they werent contagious, thankfully, but shed had to endure them for most of her life and they were intensely painful; sometimes even debilitatingly so. Doctors prescribed an ointment for her to put on them when the outbreaks occurred, but they barely took the edge off. Plus, she was deeply attached to the ideas of natural healing and homeopathy and all that, so she very, very rarely used the medication. But that night, for the first time in a while, I could tell she wasnt powering through her pain. She genuinely felt good and had no idea why. Her pain returned a few hours later. As always, she did her best to ignore it. Fast forward a couple days - another massage, another occasion for sexy times. Midway through, she stopped kissing me and exclaimed, thats it! I didnt know what she was talking about. She rolled off me and stuck her finger in my mouth. Not really sure what the hell was going on, I just sat up on the bed and let her do whatever she was doing. She pulled her wet finger from my mouth and stuck it in her own. I saw her rubbing the inside of her cheek. Her face brightened and she informed me, with complete certainty, that my saliva was taking away her pain. I laughed and said something encouraging despite thinking she was nuts. Then she hopped back on me and I completely forgot everything shed said. The next day, I was lying face down on her massage table. She was doing her usual, outstanding work while I stared down at the floor through that little padded hole where ones face goes. Without any warning, there was a blinding pain in my head. I passed out. I have no idea how long I was unconscious. When I came to, I tried to get up, but I was completely immobilized. I couldnt turn my head or lift my arms. It felt like I was taped to the table. Not only that, but there was something metal in my mouth. I couldnt close my jaw or even dislodge the thing with my tongue. I yelled around it. Valerie, whod apparently been standing next to me, simply said, shhhhhh. I saw her hand and arm appear in front of my down-turned face. She held a small, glass baking dish, which she placed on the floor under my mouth. Im sorry if the speculum is uncomfortable, she said. At the mention of the word, I gagged. A thin column of saliva drooled from my gaping maw and landed inside the glass container. She reached under and gathered a dollop of the fluid onto her fingertip. Her hand disappeared from my field of view, but I knew where it was going. I heard her moan with relief. Im not sure how long Ill keep you here, she informed me. But dont be loud. In response, I yelled. A hideously sharp pain erupted from my lower back, right around my left kidney. Thats a 3 inch long pin, Valerie said. Please dont scream anymore. I hate hurting people. As the hours went by, the bottom of the pan grew slick with a cloudy puddle of my saliva. I heard Valerie walking around the house, doing laundry, washing dishes; basic, everyday activity. The clatter of pots and pans told me it was almost dinner time. I was ravenous; I estimated itd been almost 24 hours since Id had any food. Glorious aromas wafted from the kitchen as she cooked. My salivary glands went into overdrive and I drizzled their secretions into the waiting container. I heard Val walk in and she placed a plate piled high with spaghetti carbonara and what appeared to be a pork chop directly next to the collection pan. My mouth oozed. You cant have this, she whispered in my ear. But feel free to enjoy the smell. She walked away and turned on the TV. The room filled with sitcom banalities as my body leaked its desire for the meal into the waiting dish. I wanted to cry. At some point, I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning, the plate of food was gone. The house was quiet. I assumed Val had gone to class. I gargled out a weak yell, but theres no way anyone wouldve heard it. I was so incredibly thirsty. The smell from the collected saliva was absolutely horrendous. I could see particulate matter dotting the glass bottom; probably old food that had detached from between my teeth. My mouth felt terribly dry. Saliva still leaked from the glands, but it was thick, almost like corn syrup. The color was milky gray. When it hit the stuff that was already in the pan, it separated like salad dressing. Oily liquid swirled to the top. I couldnt believe how much Id produced over the last couple days. The sound of the front door opening heralded the return of Valerie. She walked over, putting her sneakers in my narrow view. I felt her scratch the top of my head. You doing okay?, she asked, sounding genuinely concerned. I muttered something obscene from around the speculum. She bent down and picked up the pan. Saliva sloshed thickly against the sides. Im going to let you go today, Val informed me. I choked out a sigh of relief. I saw a knife for a second and was certain she was about to cut my throat. Instead, she sliced through the duct tape that was holding my head to the table. I craned my neck upward and tried to shake out the awful muscle cramps. In front of me, I watched Val carefully pour some of the accumulated spit into a glass. She brought it to her lips and took a tiny sip. I almost threw up. She didnt swallow right away. I could see her swishing it around her mouth and aerating it as if she were a disgusting sommelier sampling a fine Brunello. She smiled at me as she swallowed. Valerie reached into her purse and pulled out a small handgun. Of course she had a fucking gun. I didnt move. She calmly told me she was about to cut me loose but if I ran before she could talk to me, Id get shot. She cut the tape away. I was suddenly self-conscious as the smell of my old spit was replaced by the ammonia odor of when Id pissed myself those two times. Dont worry about it, she whispered. After everything was cut away, she apologized in advance before pulling the tape off my head to unsecure the speculum still violating my mouth. Chunks of hair came with the tape and I winced. I let the metal instrument drop to the ground. My jaw felt like itd been pummelled by a prize fighter. I stood up and Val pointed the gun at my chest. I stretched, slowly, then sat back down. She took another small sip before she spoke. When you leave, I know youre going to call the police. And I know Ill get arrested. But I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for helping me. I didnt say anything. She was nuts. She gulped down the rest of the cold saliva and put the glass on the coffee table. The pan was still 75% full. You can go, she told me. I grabbed my car keys from the table and left. As soon as I closed the door to her apartment, I sprinted as quickly as my cramped legs would allow, got into the car, and drove away. As I went home, I called 911 and did my best to explain what happened. They said theyd stop by her place and see what was going on, then theyd visit me at home. Sure enough, a few hours later, the police visited my apartment. They told me Valerie was dead. Self-inflicted gunshot wound. Shed left a note, but all it said was, youll understand soon enough. A year later, I started getting sores in my mouth. The pain was indescribable. Theyd last for a couple days before bursting. Theyd eventually heal, but two weeks later theyd just reappear. I was missing work because I couldnt even breathe through my mouth without searing agony. The doctors gave me some awful-tasting ointment to put on them, but it might as well have been water. Nothing helped. I didnt want to, but I started sleeping around. Men, women, it didnt matter. Partner after partner crossed my bed. Finally, I found one. Then another. Then another. Seven years later, theyre up to a gallon of production per day. The flavor took some getting used to, but hey, the taste of medicine doesnt matter much when it actually works. The trick, I learned, was to keep my producers hydrated and fed just enough so the quality doesnt drop off. Early on, my little cows (thats what I call them) used to be pretty boisterous in the mornings when I went to collect their milk, but theyve calmed down over the years. I just hope they know how much I appreciate them. Deep down, I bet they do. [Unsettling Stories](<URL>), [FB](<URL>)",A.1,False,0,0,[],[],,

I was annoyed. I felt guilty but the feeling of envy was too strong. I decided to go to his home later that day. I told him wed chill and watch movies. I arrived at 4:00 PM at his house. I rang the door bell and we went to his room. We decided to watch Conjuring because I love horror. Before we started the movie I asked him to grab some snacks. He went to his kitchen and I thought this was the moment. I reached to the stool on which his camera was resting. I grabbed it and threw it out the window next to me. My friend asked what was that sound? I told him I dont know. I turned off the lights and rationalized to him that true fun of horror is in the dark. After the movie finished I came back home. Next day, he told me he cant find his camera anywhere. I acted concerned but deep down I was ecstatic. Seeing him sad made me happy. I slowly started envying when I saw people having fun and posting pictures on Facebook. I needed to see someone suffer. I met my girlfriend and she told me she will be playing guitar in a local competition and I had to be there. I always wanted to play guitar but I never had a knack of it. I was jealous of her talent.

I needed something more permanent. I took a needle and started playfully scare her. I made it seem look like an accident and managed to stab her left index finger. She started screaming and crying. She was bleeding a lot. I brought some chilled water to wash the blood and later band-aided her finger. It all seemed like a prank gone wrong and that I didnt do it deliberately. She forgave me but was dejected because no way she could perform next morning because she couldnt even play the chords properly with her injured finger. I felt amazing. I acted as if I was sorry and I gave her a passionate kiss. She was still dejected because she was so excited to play at the competition. I felt ecstatic once again.

But I feel fine with the thought of never having sex-- or do I? This is going to sound perfectly ordinary, but I only get off to gay porn or fanfic. The part that I ponder over is why I feel like I would be better off as a gay dude. I'm not transexual-- at least I don't think I am. Aren't they usually pretty sure about it? I never minded being a girl. One thing of note is I find pregnancy personally abhorrent; the thought of *myself* being pregnant literally fills me with disgust. I think it might be considered a phobia of sorts. I don't think it is the cause of my asexuality, but it might be a contributor. Even before all of that realization though, I never had an interest in dating while I was still in junior high/high school. I couldn't understand why girls oogled at guys, I thought, 'sure that guy looks attractive, but why are you losing your shit over it?' I literally gave no fucks. It was only later after my second boyfriend, I realized I cannot feel sexual attraction (if I have, it was very temporary), and that I am probably asexual due to the fact that I just get disgusted with myself when it comes to the sex part. I messed around with non penetration stuff, but ultimately it got to the point where it felt disgusting. And I never actually felt connected when I was involved sexually with my boyfriend, despite how I felt toward him romantically.

Everybody's just gonna say that the future's gonna get better, and how love is like that and eventually, I'll forget the girl who fucked up my life and I'm just gonna nod and say, ""Yeah, you're right"" just because I don't wanna make it seem like they've wasted their time on me. I've been writing about what I've been feeling for the past year or so, but I don't think any of you would be interested in reading some teenager's diary about how love made him vulnerable.

I added this to the first post but Ill put it here as well. It is the note and picture the only thing I have that the police didnt take [proof](<URL>)
So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------
**UPDATE**
So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------
**FINAL UPDATE**
So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and ""earn my dinner"". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head.

s_313_967,"Straight A's I was having some trouble at college. You always hear story about how the roommate of the girl who commits suicide automatically gets straight A's. That's about all you ever hear about that girl, the one who walks in and finds the other one that way. Being back home feels weird, but at first I didn't care. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and stay in the dark away from everyone. Almost nothing changed at home since I left. The house was exactly the same. In fact, the only change was that mom didn't do her own vacuuming every day now, since she bought one of those stupid ""Roomba"" things from a Skymall magazine. I slept most of the day and night. My parents worried about me. They brought me food and offered to take me places, but I always said no - the most I could manage was to read a few posts on Reddit while avoiding Facebook and the torrent of memorials from her recently acquired array of ""best friends"" there - before rolling over and falling back into a warm, dreamless sleep. The police came to question me again. I took a shower for the first time in recent memory and faced the off-colored light of the day. My glasses were off and music was playing in my room. As I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, I stepped onto something. It was *alive*. I squealed and retreated into my room, the creature hissed and squirmed off down the hall. I still don't understand why they bought a white Roomba for cleaning their white carpet. The police said that there was new information, and asked me a bunch of weird questions about the room we shared and the rest of the dorm building. They kept asking if we knew of anyone who kept animals in the dorms, especially something like a snake or anything that laid eggs. I started to feel lightheaded and like the world was too bright for me. I just got back to bed before I started hyperventilating. I'm exhausted. It sounds lame, I know - I was up for all of three hours. Now that I'm in bed, I'm being kept up by the hissing, whirring sound of the Roomba. It's trapped in my room, and I'm too lazy to get up and open the door. The other thing that's keeping me awake is the strange way that Lucy was acting in the week before she died. She never was one to go out all the time, but that last week, she kept the curtains drawn and I don't think she ever left the room. Maybe there was something else wrong with her, like she was poisoned or...

s_1900_9,"A Simple Procedure **This is a warning! Please read my story and heed my advice! Tell everyone you can not to make the same mistake I made!** I am a fitness freak, *was* a fitness freak. Marathons, Tae Bo, P90X and Insanity, basketball twice a week, indoor soccer, free weights twice a week, cycling every Sunday morning, and exploring trails and caves in between. That is until I suffered a double hernia. I was in the early prime of my life and just beginning to peak, I mean HUGE gains the month before. My wife wasnt the happiest about how much time I spent working out but she sure appreciated the results. Anyway, back to the hernia. It would have been fine if it had been an umbilical hernia, those arent so bad. Usually back to work the next day with no complications if you are in any semblance of fitness. Of course, I wasnt so lucky. Mine were lower, very low an indirect inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia both of which I was told were congenital, meaning I was born with them. Apparently the extreme workouts built enough muscle in places I never really had to force my intestines around into wherever they could go and bam, a huge bulge just below my waistline. Insert penis joke here. Normally I wouldnt worry about it. I have pushed through injuries all the time and heal quickly. The first time I felt it happen I just pushed it back in and kept going at it, scissor kick after scissor kick. It didnt show up again for another two weeks but it hurt that time and from then on as well. I could always push it back in but it started to pop out more and more frequently. Totally freaked out my wife the first time it happened during sex, Ill tell you what. She dialed my doctor for me, still naked, and pushed the phone into my hand to make an appointment. Fast forward a few weeks and I am getting wheeled out of the clinic with a small incision and a little bag full of meds. The doctor said I was lucky nothing serious happened like intestine strangulation because it was very bad, so bad that they had to use a new procedure to fill all the gaps. I dont speak doctor but basically, she said it looked like an ant colony down there, lots of little holes and rooms for the intestines to get trapped in and back me up really good. I had taken that day, Friday, off of work to get the procedure done and had to be back on Monday bright and early something I really didnt think would be an issue. That is until I tried to take my first step or sit up in bed or take a leak. Who knew such a tiny cut could cause so much damage and pain? I made it in to work much to the dismay of my wife but I wasnt much use. I couldnt stand up fully straight and I couldnt lift or push anything over five pounds. I basically shuffled around like an old man in a robe and loafers trying to find his glasses. Towards the end of the shift, my boss called me in and asked me how I was doing (not great) and decided to give me the rest of the week off to recover faster. I wasnt happy about it, (pride you know?) but I did go home. Things didnt improve that week, nor the week after. In fact, things only progressed downward. I regained some strength and mobility but I kept getting shooting pains throughout my body that began at my incision and lanced out in all directions, pulsing once, then twice. The incision was always itchy and tingly and felt like something was moving around, burrowing or pushing my insides around. It reminded me of the ant colony analogy my doctor used thousands of ants crawling along the underside of my skin laying eggs in all of my organs and muscle tissue. My head throbbed, my eyes were itchy and red constantly, even my brain itched. Have you ever felt like that? Then, suddenly, it was all gone. The pain, the tightness in my muscles, the tickly tingles under my skin. I went back to work like nothing had ever happened, stronger and spryer than before, like I hadnt missed almost a month of workouts. In fact, my usual weights seemed a bit lighter and I was quicker than I used to be on the basketball court. I hit the gym hard for a month trying to capitalize on this high I was on and turn it into sick gains. As they say, though, all good things must come to an end. It started out small a missed step up the stairs or my hand letting go of a weight mid-curl like a total gym-tool. Each day it seemed to get worse, more missed steps, sometimes even going the wrong direction. Cutting to the left and out of bounds is pretty embarrassing in the middle of a championship basketball game. It was like I had zero control of my body! I am not sure what prompted me but I began looking into the new procedure they had used on me during my outpatient operation. I couldnt quite remember what the doctor had said so it took a while for me to find it but it is called Nanomesh and it is supposed to fix all the issues they have had in the past with mesh inserts slipping, getting rejected by the surrounding tissues, and causing internal pain and bleeding. Instead, this mesh is flexible and adapts to your body so that it can blend right into any multitude of tissues it is placed by and can stretch and even grow to close off holes that appear near it. In theory, it sounds awesome. In practice, however, all the kinks havent been worked out quite right. So here we are in the here and now. Things have become much worse since I have begun to type this up almost two weeks ago. I have had to resort to writing out a section in random emails or on forums and then cutting and pasting them into this document in order to fool myself (hopefully it will all make sense) but I dont know how much longer Ill be able to keep it up. It is learning quickly, taking over more and more each day. I think it has spread much further than just a few inches to heal newly formed holes. It is in my brain, controlling everything I do. Sometimes I can force myself but often I fail, unable to break through the hold it has on my body. My wife is lying on the floor next to me, dead. I, it, we, killed her after a few questions too many for our liking. She is really decomposed now, and the flies are coating her so thickly I cant even see her once beautiful hair. Fortunately, the mesh has turned off my ability to smell otherwise Id probably vomit from the stench of her rotting flesh. Once I finish this I am going to try and kill myself. I doubt it will work but maybe I can trick it, or force someone to kill me. Please, if you get a hernia or need anything like a mesh insert **do not** let them use Nanomesh.

s_264_2,"I was at a dinner party with a few friends one time. It was me, my best friend, a few couples, the hosts family (husband, wife, three kids) and the grand parents. At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers. The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her. She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled. Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit. He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god. **TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.** nbsp;

EDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways. One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house. I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement. The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it. Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night. At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there. I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid. A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though. **TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.**",A.4,True,0,1,[],"[(-1, -1)]",,

Step One required me to admit that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that I am powerless over these illnesses, and that my life is unmanageable by me. Since I believe that I am a sex addict and a sexual anorexic, that means I have a disease of the mind, body, and spirit that reacts very negatively to all sexual stimuli.

s_2815_1699,"Teeny-Tiny My doctors asked me to tell my story so other girls like me could read it and learn from my mistakes because Ill be dead soon. That makes me pretty sad to think about. I dont want other girls to be sick like I am. I guess they wont be sick exactly like me, because that would be crazy, but maybe they can read this so they wont make the bad decisions I made. When I was little, Mom used to hold me and say stuff like, Oh Katie, you fit so perfectly on my lap! Youre so teeny-tiny! I loved it. Shed keep me warm and hug me and I felt so great. Id always go to Mom if I felt sad or scared and shed just scoop me up, saying whats wrong, my teeny-tiny girl? and Id tell her what was making me upset and shed always always always make it all better. The most vivid memory I have was the day I turned 10. It wasnt of my party, which I vaguely remember being great, it wasnt the presents, some of which I still have, but it was when Mom had me in her lap that night and had tears in her eyes and said to Dad, Katies getting to be a big girl, huh? I dont remember what my dad said, but there was no denying it: I wasnt her teeny-tiny girl anymore. At 10 years old, I was about 410, maybe 100 pounds. I was growing fast. Both my parents are tall. I remember being scared. The scale kept going up, and by the time I was 11 I was 52, 120 pounds and I started getting boobs. At that point, when I was sad, mom would hug me tight and say the right things, but it all felt different. She never cradled me. She never had me in her lap. I felt cold and lonely even though I was never really cold or lonely. I just wanted to be closer to her like I was when I was little. So I decided to get little again. Mom started to notice when I pushed around my food on the plate, trying to pile it up on one side to make it look like I ate more than I really did. Youre a growing girl, she said, kindly but firmly. You need to eat. I couldnt leave the table until I was done. That night after dinner, I remember lying on my back on the bed, staring at the ceiling and feeling the food in my stomach. Moms words youre a growing girl echoed in my mind and I felt so sick that I ran into the bathroom and threw up. I was really glad I had my own bathroom so they couldnt hear me puking. After I was done, I felt so much better. Lighter and smaller, even. Mom was so happy to see me eating normally again. She had worried aloud that I might be getting the flu, so seeing me chowing down like my old self pushed those worries right out of her head. What she didnt see was how I went to bed afterward and while the bathwater ran I was throwing it all up. I did this every day for years. One of the sad truths about throwing up your meals is that you dont lose all that much weight. I actually gained more. Sure, Id get rid of what Id eaten, but probably twice a week Id be lying in bed, wide awake, fingering my collar bones, hip bones, and ribs, and obsessing over food. Something inside me would snap, and Id run to the fridge or the cabinets and eat until I felt like I was bursting. Then, exhausted, Id go back upstairs and pass out on my bed. Calorie-for-calorie, after those twice-weekly binges I was eating more than I would if I was healthy. Except I really, really wasnt healthy. And nobody knew. All this built up to the last few months after I graduated high school. I was 511, 175lbs. 17 years old. There was absolutely nothing I hated more than my body. I was constantly lonely and wanted to try to take my mind off it all. I decided to get a job. When I told Mom I found a position at a place that recycles old medical gear, she was really proud of me for taking the initiative. It was bittersweet; I knew she was starting to see me as an adult. Not her teeny-tiny girl. I felt like a complete and utter failure. The recycling place where I worked dismantled big machines that hospitals used and sold the parts. I was the receptionist. I took phone calls and helped set up deliveries. The people I worked with were really nice and after a few weeks they gave me a key so I could get there early and have their coffee ready and their work orders printed out. That night, after everyone had left, I went back there and let myself in. I still feel bad about breaking their trust. A couple days earlier my coworkers were bringing in an old machine. They all were wearing heavy gloves and had on breathing gear like scuba divers. When they were done, I asked what it was. Apparently it was something hospitals use to give radiation therapy to cancer patients. I didnt know too much about that, so when I got home I went on Wikipedia and did a lot of research and then I got my idea. When I let myself in that night, the place was empty. I made a beeline for where they had that radiation therapy machine and I investigated it. Most of it was completely dismantled. What I was looking for was conveniently labeled and brightly marked in a massive lead container. It took me a while to get the cover off. Leads so heavy! But after I did, I saw a round metal part that looked like a wheel. I picked it up, rotated the mechanism, and it opened a little window in the front. A faint blue light was inside. I held it up to my eye and looked in. Nothing but that light. I thought it was probably what I was looking for. I brought the object home with me and locked the door of my bedroom. I worked to pry the thing open with a screwdriver but it seemed locked from the inside. Eventually I got frustrated and I turned the wheel again to open the window and pushed my screwdriver into the blue light stuff and tried scooping it out. It turned out to be pretty soft. A lot of it broke as I poked it with the screwdriver, and when I turned the wheel upside down, it tumbled out onto my desk. Now I could see how pretty it was. It was like chunks of glowing blue clay and sand. I gathered it up as best I could and put it away, save for the little bit I was going to use tonight. One of the things Id read about radiation therapy was that it made the poor people with cancer really skinny. They just totally lost their appetites. I couldnt believe it was true. Id always had such a big appetite. I kept telling myself that I need to be really careful when I take this stuff because if I get too much of the radiation I could get cancer myself. I took a pinch of the blue stuff, put it in my mouth, and swallowed it with a gulp of water. It felt warm going down even though the water was cold. Since Id gotten home from the recycling place Id been pretty warm, in fact. Like a little puppy under a blanket. That night I woke up sweating worse than Id ever sweated in my life. The bed was totally soaked. I figured weight loss was weight loss. Water weight wasnt really what I wanted, but it was better than nothing. I took a shower and changed the sheets and went back to bed. My stomach ached a little. When I woke up the next morning, my stomach hurt and I threw up a couple times. But, I wasnt even remotely hungry. That alone made the pain in my tummy pretty much go away. I didnt need to eat! Mom asked if I was bringing leftovers to work from last nights dinner and I lied and said we were going to get a pizza. I hate lying to Mom, but I didnt want her to worry. There was no need to tell her I wasnt hungry. At work, theyd finished disassembling the machine and started sending it out to wherever they send those things. Id been really careful to put the canister back exactly as I left it. No one checked to see if the little wheel was still there. The next few days were uneventful, aside from my stomach ache getting worse and having to puke once or twice. Id barely eaten anything since I started taking the radiation medicine. Whenever I got woozy from lack of food I ate an apple or a fat-free yogurt and I was fine. I was still sweating a lot. When I got on the scale, it said 168. After a week of eating nearly nothing and faithfully taking my radiation medicine nightly, my stomach ache got really, really bad. Id stopped throwing up, but this time it felt like I needed to go to the bathroom. I went, and it was awful. There was so much - I was shocked. Id apparently eaten and kept down more than I thought. It was agony coming out, too. I got on the scale after, though, and that helped me feel a lot better. Over the next couple days, one or two people told me how pretty I looked. They asked me if I lost weight and I said yeah, maybe a few pounds. Over my whole adolescence Id done nothing but get bigger. Now, finally, I was shrinking and on the way to teeny-tiny. I didnt feel too great, though. My tummy was constantly having me run to the bathroom and it still hurt afterwards. I figured I was getting rid of all the extra fat. I was in the shower about 10 days after I started taking the medicine and I was horrified to see some of my hair coming out. That was bad. Really, really, really bad. I stopped washing it immediately and let just the water rinse away the remainder of the shampoo. I got out of the shower and took like an hour blow drying my hair because I was too scared to use a towel that might pull more out. When the mirror was unfogged and my hair was dry, I checked to see how noticeable it was. There was a good-sized patch of bare, red scalp about 2 wide above my left ear. I pushed the hair around it down to cover the patch. Some more fell out. It had to be a nutritional deficiency from all the meals Id been missing. I put on my Titans hat and got dressed. When I brushed my teeth I noticed a little blood in the sink. I made a note to get some multivitamins after work. I didnt shower the next day because when I woke up that morning, there was more hair on my pillow. My scalp was getting pretty visible. It looked prickly and raw but it didnt hurt. Since I was off work I stayed at home and looked online for all the nutritional deficiencies that might cause my hair to fall out and my gums to bleed. Most of the ones were covered by my multivitamin, so I tripled the amount I took just to be on the safe side. I had to go to the bathroom five times during the 15 hours I was awake. By the last time I was incredibly light-headed and so thirsty. I weighed myself before I started downing water and my radiation medicine. The medicine had helped me lose 25 pounds in less than two weeks. Mom hugged me the next morning before I went to work. She ran her hands up and down my back and she remarked about how skinny Id gotten. Then, she said it: remember when I used to call you my teeny-tiny girl? I miss those days but I love you just as much as a grown up. Then she let me go. Pain, nausea, and despair washed over me. All of a sudden, my lightheadedness came back with a vengeance and I stumbled and fell on the kitchen floor. My hat fell off. With my head spinning, I vaguely remember Mom gasping, Katie what happened to your hair?! before I violently threw up on the floor and myself. It was all blood. I passed out to the sound of Mom screaming. I dont know how much time went by at the hospital. I wasnt completely unconscious, but all I remember up until recently when they used drugs to wake me up were images of doctors in the same scuba gear as the guys at work and saying weird words like caesium chloride and sloughed and gray that didnt mean the color. Today, I cant move or talk and Im writing this using a cool keyboard that can pick out letters using the movements of my remaining eye. Like I said in the beginning, Ill be dead soon. Im not too fun to look at anymore. My hairs gone. And my lower jaw. And my skin. The nice doctors are giving me medication that helps me manage the pain and keep me alert. They asked if they could do tests and experiments on me to help understand what ingestion of the radiation medicine does to the human body. Apparently there was a man in Japan a few years ago named Hiroshi Ouchi who got a similar level of exposure and the same stuff happened to him. They said it would help other people in the future if they could compare our two cases. Of course I let them. I cant eat food anymore. My esophagus got cooked away. Same with my stomach. The doctors are keeping me hydrated with a tube in my butt. I dont really like to think about it. I guess all the excitement I get as I wait here is when they weigh me every six hours to see if Im able to retain the fluids they give me or if it all seeps out into the sheets. They hoist me onto a pad and a little machine voice says a number. This morning it said 72. The next time it was 69. Mom and Dad have to wear those scuba suits when they come visit. Moms always crying because shes not allowed to touch me. Dad just stares. Right before I started writing this, Mom bent down and started whispering to me some of the stuff I remember her saying when I was small. I closed my eye and imagined being warm and safe on her lap. I love you, my teeny-tiny girl, she sobbed. I would have smiled if I had a mouth.",A.3,True,0,1,[],"[(-1, -1)]",,

s_481_30,"[17/m] I'm in a triangle with two friends and it's driving me insane, would love some advice :) So I've been friends with this girl I really like, and long story short, I really think I love her. I know it sounds stupid af, but just hear me out. I've never even tried to be in love because I'm so scared of a broken heart. Then she came along, and we became friends. We hang out a lot after school and text. We even have the gold heart thing on Snapchat. It sounds cringy, I know, just hang in there :D
On Snapchat, she sends me pictures where she clearly poses and takes the time to make them look good. Some of my friends actually thinks we're dating, but we're not. I say some because I think she likes another guy, and he happens to be my close friend. While she acts like she likes me (she must just be really polite idk), she's more physical with him (he sits in her lap and sleeps on her shoulder). I've also seen her drawings of him playing the piano (she's a really good artist). He's a really good guy, and if there is a thing between those two, I would hate to be a jerk to either of them and get in the way. We're both (the other guy and me) really good at the piano and we both play video games. I guess I have more in common with her than he does cuz we (the girl and me) love to write and watch anime (the other guy doesn't do either). All three of us are pretty weird though even though we're all well liked as people at school. The problem is that I actually really like her. I've never felt this way with anyone and I sometimes feel like I'm accidentally gonna blurt out ""I love you."" This whole unofficial love triangle has been going on for months now, and it's driving me insane. The one time I actually feel emotionally invested in someone, I know it's just a dead end because I have a long history of losing. The other part of me wants to desperately win because I don't think I'll ever find someone quite as unique as her. I might get close and I might find other unique people, but she's special. Bottom line, I think I'm being led on, and she's going to eventually fall in love with him. I'm just so freaking terrified by this because I know it's going to break my heart. And isn't that why I never tried to get close with a girl before? I have planned my final attempt. If this doesn't win her heart, then I'm dropping it, and I'll deal with the sadness. I wrote her a song that's not specifically addressed to her, but she'll realize at the end who I'm referring to. I already booked a slot in the upcoming Valentine's Day assembly at school so I'm pretty set on doing this. Other than that, do you think that I should just drop it? If so, if you could give me some coping mechanisms to deal with the pain, that would be awesome. Thanks, and you're the best :)

s_1831_20,"Everything I know is going upside down. I can't take it anymore. I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and ""fun"" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then. Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing ""the right thing"" and that everything was going to be better now. What a fucking liar. After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of ""the best of the best"". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to ""become healthier"" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house. Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were ""incapable and horrible at raising us"". Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night. I can't concentrate, and my addiction to Smash Bros. and it's world has become destructive. I've stopped caring about things, my future, my friends, nothing but trying to escape the real world. Each night, I'm doing plenty of chores, taking care of all three dogs, taking care of dinner occasionally, sometimes trying to do schoolwork and spending the rest of the time on Imgur, Skype and Reddit, browsing for no true reason. My mom is smoking a pack a day, and, when she's not working, is laying in bed feeling sick. My grandma is wheeling around, being demanding and yelling at us about stupid crap that doesn't matter. She attempted to stab my mother with a fork because my grandma took a burger from us and tried to feed it to the dogs, and when my mom tried to stop her, my grandma yelled that ""she's trying to help the only ones that matter to her."" My brother is remaining oblivious to most of it, thankfully, but is glued to his Kindle and spends most of the time avoiding his work, making me do it. Dad's at work and only sees us occasionally, and that's driving him mad, and grandpa's with his significant other, doing what he pleases and being cheap on us. I've contemplated suicide once or twice, but I've never acted on it because I know it will only cause more pain to my family. I'm nearly at the point of giving up. I can't do anything anymore without causing someone trouble. None of my friends really try to help, and my family's attempts to help me have failed. I'm becoming violent, and beginning to obsess over stupid things like those little Nintendo amiibo figures. My life is a mess, and I have no way of escape anymore. Collecting and buying the figures gives me moments of false happiness, as does playing video games. My family is constantly fighting, and I can't do anything to fix it.

s_982_722,"I attempted suicide. Some of you will know me for the post that almost nobody could read. Here's a link in case you don't know what I'm talking about. <URL>
Don't worry, I'm not posting anything like that again. I've learned my lesson, and it drove me near to death's cold hand. I tried starving myself to death. Alone, isolated, and hungry, I collapsed from hunger 12 days into the fast. I was absolutely prepared to die, but I woke up mere hours later in the hospital. I gave my family an extreme heart attack. They asked why I did it, and I told them the whole story. A few weeks ago, I met a girl online. It was through her older sister. On YouTube, she left a comment on one of my videos saying it made her day and that she had been contemplating suicide as well. Two days later, she decided against it. It wasn't just chatting with me. She liked the company she had at home which also convinced her, and it included her sister. When the girl and I were talking on Skype, she had to step away. Her little sister filled in for her. She and I shared pictures and decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after just an hour of chatting. She stayed on social media for as long as she could just to see if I would log on. I would go on just to talk to her. But, suddenly, she just vanished from social media. Her older sister said she had committed suicide herself. A knife through the stomach. Bled to death. Despite telling my family all of this, I conveniently left out the part about writing a cipher and trying to reach her through a public message. Who the hell would believe that? I don't even believe she heard me anymore. I was told all my life that people who commit suicide neither go to heaven nor hell. Somewhere different. A special limbo of unforgiving nothingness I guess. I wanted to say a proper goodbye. I found a cipher online. If I encrypted a letter to her and posted it somewhere public, she would get the message as soon as someone could decipher it. The rules were simple. People had to see it publicly and I couldn't tell anyone is was a cipher, I couldn't tell anyone to decipher it, and I couldn't give anyone the solution. The last rule is I could only post it to one website and only once on that website. I posted to reddit. Other sites were no good since I had no friends to see it, and they wouldn't care. And then they would know about my online relationship. The creepypasta subreddit was perfect. I would have someone decipher it and not think I was serious. But I still wanted to see her. My poor logic clouded my better judgment. The foggy road led to one place for all suicides. All suicides lead to Rome? If I was dead, I was going to see her. That's how it worked in the way I thought about it. But I'm not brave enough to plunge a knife through my heart or jump off a building. And now my memory of the cipher feels fuzzy. Everytime I think about it, I seem to remember it less, and it causes me to feel desperate to see her. Ill be in therapy for a while to get over this.

I never enjoy anything in life (I'm also depressed and I have many mental issues) and I'm always tired and unmotivated about everything. And every single day feels as a heavy work day, even if I am at home having ""free"" time. There are 2 reasons of my high stress. Reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone, which costs alot of effort and time. Before you read this, I am NOT here for dating advice, so please dont, unless you have a magic trick that will 100% sure work for ME. Since 4 years ago when I was 17, I started developing interest in girls. Now, 21, I still never had a relationship, but even worse, I never had a date or even a female friend even though I have tried different strategies which I failed. I never hugged a girl either. I have exactly 0 experience with girls. Why am I so stressed? It is because those 4 years, first of all: being single makes me unhappy. And second: I have been trying very hard to find a girl, to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend. Every single day I waste my time on ~~dating~~ i mean ENDLESS SWIPING apps. ( read: neverending swiping but never getting a match), asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend, asking google how to get a girlfriend, thinking about being single forever, you know what I mean. I waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me, I have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps, I really tried stuff too. Nothing works. So how can I feel less stressed? Find the love of my life and be happy, but this won't happen any time soon, it seems impossible. So what can I do to get my mind off the impossible? I really have hobbies and interests, I have a life so that's not the problem here. The only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend. I feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and im starting to hate life. Seeing guys getting girlfriends as if it's the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry. These days even 10 year old kids have relationships. I guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser. I am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that I have no more focus on anything else in my life. I dont care about family anymore, I dont care about my friends anymore, I dont care about my hobbies anymore, I dont care about study anymore, I dont care about anything except I just want a girlfriend. How can I be happy without having a partner? Really, I have study, I have a great family, I have friends, I have a hobby, my life is fine.

Is there anything I can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life? Whenever I play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy, it doesnt really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever, stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what i'm doing or focusing on.

s_2135_7,"Getting my ADHD diagnosis and meds was the best thing that ever happened to me. I've had depression several times and always been anxious and felt like I was not dumb, but that I was dumb if that makes sense? I've had toxic relationships because I never felt good enough due to me being ex bad at listening at times, distracted, ""lazy"" with house work and just extremely self conscious, which made me feel like everything I did was wrong. I've had a hard time following through on projects, could not focus in school or do homework, even tho I was bright enough and had a lot of sexual issues as well. Last summer/fall I got a major depression. The worst I ever had. I never took medication for my depressions, as a friend of mine took bad antidepressants and got all fucked, so that scared me. But this time I was SO miserable, that I just wanted it to be fixed and after struggling with our mental healthcare system (I live in Denmark) for months and being send around to new psychiatrists who needed to interview me for 1-2 hours from scratch each time and then decide I was not their field, I finally got to an amazing psychiatrist. I asked all the others, if I could possibly be diagnosed with ADHD, but they all specialized in depression and send me around. I did not even ask my psychiatrist about it, she just said that I might have ADHD and we needed to look into that and then I got my diagnosis and started drugs. The drugs changed my life. One brand made me extremely nauseous, but the ones I have now only have a few side effects (I do not have a lot of appetite and used to be eating and snacking ALL THE TIME, so this thing with eating when not hungry and remembering to eat is a bit of a challenge, but it is working out now). But I do have a much easier time focusing. Both on smaller tasks at hand, like reading an e-mail or making coffee without burning myself, but also on organizing my stuff, cleaning and my job. I also feel calmer and fresher at the same time, which make social events and being around my partner much easier and I feel more connected to my body and more present, which makes it easier for me to be the person I want to be. Both in terms of job and social/romantic realtionships. I also sleep better and are much less anxious. I still have a bit of ADHD symptoms of course, but I fell much less embarrassed and in control of myself and my diagnosis have also learned me to cope with it mentally. To give myself permission to be different and not aim to do everything perfect all the time. I am working on the stuff, I want to change (like talking a lot), but also accepting that it is a part of me and that I have to live with that I don't use my diagnosis as an excuse, but as a reason. I'm not perfect and that is okay. I try my best and don't always succeed, but I do try my best, and that is the best I can do. I also try to explain, what I am experiencing to my friends, partner and family, so they can understand better, that when I ex talk for one hour about something completely boring and they tell me something important and I don't listen, it is not because I feel more important than them or do not have any interest in them they just need to tell me; ""Now I want to say something important"" and I'll focus on listening. And I am aware, that this is something I do and I work to change it, but beating myself up about it all the time, even tho I hate it, just gives me anxiety and makes it even harder to control myself. I also feel much less overwhelmed/fussy/like my head is melting after having to focus or meet people. I sleep better at night. I feel better about myself and have more energy to change or do stuff in my life, to make it better applying for a challenging, but interesting job or just organising my clothes, so it is easier to find what I need.

I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake.

My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me. I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though. No wonder I'm going to die alone. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter.

I was on cytalopram for a while but it didn't do much for me. Luckily about three years ago I found medications that worked for me. The current pills I'm taking are SNRIs, the primary agent being venlafaxine. Last Monday I was supposed to go see my psychiatrist but I was making an important call during my lunch break and I forgot. I thought to myself: what harm could it do? I had some leftovers from previous appointments and I would only miss a day's worth. How callous I was. So this is how I felt: sensory overload in every turn. Every sound delved into my head like a jackhammer. I put on earphones without listening to anything but it didn't do anything. My coworker's keyboard typing which I would normally ignore was so painful that I had to leave the room for a while. Secretaries walking fast-paced here and there hit me like a gong. It resonated within me. They irritated me and numbed me to the core at the same time. I wanted to attack someone. I turned to work to maintain focus. I work as a translator at a law firm. I usually work on court decisions, briefs, complaints, etc. I'm always fascinated by the stories I read. It lessens the inevitable boredom destined to come with the line of my profession. I picture them in my head and it helps me visualize. Concentrate. I was assigned to translate a complaint a few days ago so I was working on it. I tried to calm myself as I tried to regain control over my senses and just work. It was okay for a while until I hit the word SUICIDE. A former rep director of a company being sued had committed suicide. Normally I would just look upon it with some dismay and move on. It's really unfortunate but what can I do? In this instance I couldn't just move on. My eyes were fixed on the word. I felt like I was about to throw up. I didn't know the person. And yet the word stabbed me and I was left in shock. I wanted to cry. That was when I decided I couldn't stay in the office. I had taken the meds at that point but it wasn't working fast enough. I had to go home. I feel better now. I can withstand my surroundings once more. The words don't send me into shock like before. I thought I'd share this with you while the memory and the sensations are still fresh. My mom always tells me to ""will the depression away"". I'm not just having a bad day. I can't function without these pills. Call me a weak-willed person if you want.
