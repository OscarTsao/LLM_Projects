s_1270_9,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Im not sleeping and my stomach hurts I recently diagnosed myself with adhd, c-ptsd and possibly ASD with extreme executive dysfunction. Ever since running away from insane abusive parents, I was living alone, and I wasnt even able to feed myself on my own. If not for deliveries, I would be long dead. I hate delivery food so much. This has been going on for two years, and my health became worse. I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move. Eventually I was able to stall everything. My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights. For the past week my stomach has been very bad. I guess that skipping breakfast for two years does have consequences. I had two months when I was able to fix my sleep, but now I cant fall asleep until sunrise again. Every new panic attack is more suicidal that previous. I so many plans for many human lifetimes and I dont want to die, but Im suffering way too much. Much more that a human body was made to withstand. Funny enough my adhd so far has prevented me from focusing on self harm, but it doesnt last forever.","I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move.",398,3,1

s_2392_17,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Treatment wise I couldn't find anything that worked for me and I looked for about 20 years. Recently I gave up dairy products and now very frequently sleep straight through 6-8 hours a night. There was a time when I was getting 6 hours sleep per week. A small caveat to that it I recently switched to 50mg of Trazadone as well, but if I eat even two eggs during the day I won't sleep at night. I am still trying to work out why I didn't try it before but I currently think that there really were no indicators of allergy or intolerance. Then again, maybe I am just trying to persuade myself that I am not totally stupid! I am bloody glad that the sleepless nights are over though. Good luck to those who are still working on it.

Most advices don't work for me. Trust me, I have had so many advices, I tried so much. Doesnt work for me. So read everything before posting I'm a 21 year old guy, still studying, 1,85 / 6'0 tall, average looking, bad social skills. I'm not specifically looking for introvert women, but I do have a problem with overly extravert women. Like, those who talk to strangers for no more reason than ""small talk"". I dont know why, it just annoys me alot. Can't be my girlfriend I prefer the quiet ones. 6 reasons why I can't get a girlfriend or even a date or a female friend 1. the combination of being introvert and having ASD and being a weirdo, has made my social skills horrible. Because of my ASD I can never be socially skilled as normal people. It will never be natural to me even if I practise so much. I think women can always smell that something is different about me and that I'm not condifent in socially challenging situations. Online dating doesn't work for me. I'm not ugly but I guess I'm not attractive enough for women. I don't get swiped right on. And if I rarely get a match, I end up being ghosted although I never send any creepy or needy or sexual messages. I do have conversations with women, but 90% of the time a woman I meet is not what I'm looking for, so there it ends. Even in places of my interests. When I have conversations with women, that is always in places where we are both part of the same group of people. And 10% of them women who I like, even if its only a little bit (I'm open minded and not picky so thats not the problem) I have no idea how to take the next step in asking her out privately. I mean to meet when the group does not. I have never had a date and I have no idea where, when and how to ask a woman out for a date. I have no idea in which places and times it is appropriate or not to ask a woman out. + my social skills will mess it up if I even try to ask a woman out. Because of my depression (yes I really got diagnosed) I have less interest in everything. I have no real hobbies. I spend my days gaming and browsing the internet. I'm very open minded to go outside and do fun things together with a woman, but as long as I'm alone I really have nothing to do outside. You can say I'm a pretty boring person. Trust me, I tried different hobbies, it's just not for me. I'm not interested in anything. I can't enjoy anything in life. I tried, really. I'm willing to go outside and try hobbies with a woman but the problem is that right now I have not much to talk about on dating apps and maybe on a first date. I strongly prefer introverted women because 1. they are my type and 2. their social skills will probably not be good enough to smell that i'm not confident and socially skilled. Problem is that I have no idea where to find introverted women. Every time I go out, I only meet women who are overly extraverted and obviously not my type. They are too different from me. I know that introvert women are probably at home as much as I am, so I don't know how to get in contact with them... Yeah online dating, but those shitty apps like tinder have proven to not work at all for me. Not at all. So what have I tried and what am I still trying? I tried about 10 different dating apps and they all gave me no dates. I decided to stop wasting my time on these dati- ehh i mean swiping apps. Yeah because all I can do there is swiping. Not dating. I'm still trying to be social and make friends but my social skills mess it up every time. I tried improving my social skills for many years already but being social will never be natural and easy for me. I go outside, I meet with strangers, I talk with them, I approach women if they look even the slightest attractive, I just don't know how to go from a conversation to having her number or asking her on a date outside of the place where I met her. I also don't know what to talk about since I don't really have hobbies. The problem is not that I have no hobbies, because Im willing to try any hobbies for a girl. Its just that I dont know what to talk about. Dating apps will not work for me. I get 0 likes, 0 matches and if i get one I will be ghosted soon. My social circle, my friends, no. There are no nice women of my age in my social circle. University, I don't like anyone in my class, so I will HAVE TO approach strangers. Which I can't because my social skills are terrible and they can smell it. Make female friends without the intention of a relationship? Same problem, I have no idea how to achieve this either. ***All of this doesn't work for me. What options do I have left to try??***",I'm not interested in anything.,2450,1,1

How long should I give it to work before calling my pcp? 33F, White, 155lbs, 54. Medications: Esomeprazole 40mg, Zoloft 50 mg. I take a probiotic supplement for IBS-C. Medical conditions: GERD, IBS-C. Relevant history: I have a tube already in my left ear . Its been in place for about 18 months, and was checked a few months back and still place and looking good. Also, my two kids have had some general crud this week: low-grade fevers, sneezing, and snotty noses. They werent seen at the doctor, but seem to be recovered now. I started feeling poorly Friday, just a headache and a little mucus in my nose. Saturday (yesterday,) I woke up with a swollen lymph node in front of my left ear (I think its called preauricular) that was ridiculously painful and my ear started to hurt slightly throughout the day. I called Doctor on Demand who prescribed me prednisone for the lymph node and told me to start Flonase. I slept 10 hours last night, which is a lot for me, and then took a 2 hour nap today. I dont have a fever, but feel slightly chilled and clammy like I am feverish. My ear feels slightly full, and the left side of my face is tender, in addition to the headache. I got really light headed randomly this afternoon as well. I have taken the 20mg prednisone last night and today, and have three more days of it to take. I feel really terrible, and fatigued. How long should I wait before being seen in person? The last time my ear got really good and infected, it was months before I was able to get it cleared up and hearing out of it again, so Im trying to avoid that.

s_2338_920,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"[Rant] Grocery store parking lots I just need to get this off my chest because I can't stop crying. I almost hit a family today with my car, pregnant mother included. I was waiting to back out, letting cars pass me in my tiny Prius C, struggling to look around the big truck parked next to me. Finally a break in the cars passing, so I start to back out slowly. Then I see a woman to my right looking terrified, so I stop and look around me and I see a man yelling at me. I shrug, say ""I'm so sorry!"", look around me once more and keep backing up. More yelling as I see a 30 week pregnant woman rushing to walk out of the way as I start to back out again. Turns out she was in my huuuge blind spot (the corner of my car). I start crying, yell ""I'm so sorry"" and finally back out and drive away. Now I can't stop crying. I can't be for sure I didn't tap someone with my car because I didn't get out and ask like I should have. I'm trying to reassure myself that there wasn't frantic screaming as I was trying to pull away, just me getting the finger from the man and yelled at. I also didn't feel anything as I was backing out. Now I'm going to live in constant fear for the upcoming weeks that the police are going to show up at my door and haul me away. Fuck my car's blind spot, fuck my apparently not thorough checking all my mirrors and windows. At least for once I'm not trying to blame the family, though it did cross my mind for a second. **EDIT** Thank you all SO MUCH. I feel so much better.
