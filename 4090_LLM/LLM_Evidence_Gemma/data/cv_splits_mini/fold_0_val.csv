s_1270_9,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Im not sleeping and my stomach hurts I recently diagnosed myself with adhd, c-ptsd and possibly ASD with extreme executive dysfunction. Ever since running away from insane abusive parents, I was living alone, and I wasnt even able to feed myself on my own. If not for deliveries, I would be long dead. I hate delivery food so much. This has been going on for two years, and my health became worse. I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move. Eventually I was able to stall everything. My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights. For the past week my stomach has been very bad. I guess that skipping breakfast for two years does have consequences. I had two months when I was able to fix my sleep, but now I cant fall asleep until sunrise again. Every new panic attack is more suicidal that previous. I so many plans for many human lifetimes and I dont want to die, but Im suffering way too much. Much more that a human body was made to withstand. Funny enough my adhd so far has prevented me from focusing on self harm, but it doesnt last forever.","My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights.",567,3,1
