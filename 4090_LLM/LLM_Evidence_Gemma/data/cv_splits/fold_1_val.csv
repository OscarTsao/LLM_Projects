s_1404_102,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"Asking advice in a more detailed and extensive post. Read everything before commenting. Most advices simply don't work for me. Most advices don't work for me. Trust me, I have had so many advices, I tried so much. Doesnt work for me. So read everything before posting I'm a 21 year old guy, still studying, 1,85 / 6'0 tall, average looking, bad social skills. I'm not specifically looking for introvert women, but I do have a problem with overly extravert women. Like, those who talk to strangers for no more reason than ""small talk"". I dont know why, it just annoys me alot. Can't be my girlfriend I prefer the quiet ones. 6 reasons why I can't get a girlfriend or even a date or a female friend 1. the combination of being introvert and having ASD and being a weirdo, has made my social skills horrible. Because of my ASD I can never be socially skilled as normal people. It will never be natural to me even if I practise so much. I think women can always smell that something is different about me and that I'm not condifent in socially challenging situations. Online dating doesn't work for me. I'm not ugly but I guess I'm not attractive enough for women. I don't get swiped right on. And if I rarely get a match, I end up being ghosted although I never send any creepy or needy or sexual messages. I do have conversations with women, but 90% of the time a woman I meet is not what I'm looking for, so there it ends. Even in places of my interests. When I have conversations with women, that is always in places where we are both part of the same group of people. And 10% of them women who I like, even if its only a little bit (I'm open minded and not picky so thats not the problem) I have no idea how to take the next step in asking her out privately. I mean to meet when the group does not. I have never had a date and I have no idea where, when and how to ask a woman out for a date. I have no idea in which places and times it is appropriate or not to ask a woman out. + my social skills will mess it up if I even try to ask a woman out. Because of my depression (yes I really got diagnosed) I have less interest in everything. I have no real hobbies. I spend my days gaming and browsing the internet. I'm very open minded to go outside and do fun things together with a woman, but as long as I'm alone I really have nothing to do outside. You can say I'm a pretty boring person. Trust me, I tried different hobbies, it's just not for me. I'm not interested in anything. I can't enjoy anything in life. I tried, really. I'm willing to go outside and try hobbies with a woman but the problem is that right now I have not much to talk about on dating apps and maybe on a first date. I strongly prefer introverted women because 1. they are my type and 2. their social skills will probably not be good enough to smell that i'm not confident and socially skilled. Problem is that I have no idea where to find introverted women. Every time I go out, I only meet women who are overly extraverted and obviously not my type. They are too different from me. I know that introvert women are probably at home as much as I am, so I don't know how to get in contact with them... Yeah online dating, but those shitty apps like tinder have proven to not work at all for me. Not at all. So what have I tried and what am I still trying? I tried about 10 different dating apps and they all gave me no dates. I decided to stop wasting my time on these dati- ehh i mean swiping apps. Yeah because all I can do there is swiping. Not dating. I'm still trying to be social and make friends but my social skills mess it up every time. I tried improving my social skills for many years already but being social will never be natural and easy for me. I go outside, I meet with strangers, I talk with them, I approach women if they look even the slightest attractive, I just don't know how to go from a conversation to having her number or asking her on a date outside of the place where I met her. I also don't know what to talk about since I don't really have hobbies. The problem is not that I have no hobbies, because Im willing to try any hobbies for a girl. Its just that I dont know what to talk about. Dating apps will not work for me. I get 0 likes, 0 matches and if i get one I will be ghosted soon. My social circle, my friends, no. There are no nice women of my age in my social circle. University, I don't like anyone in my class, so I will HAVE TO approach strangers. Which I can't because my social skills are terrible and they can smell it. Make female friends without the intention of a relationship? Same problem, I have no idea how to achieve this either. ***All of this doesn't work for me. What options do I have left to try??***",I'm not interested in anything.,2450,1,1

s_258_598,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"Hey, this a very important question and Im glad you decided to post it. Headaches and unbearable fatigue are the first that seem the most prominent for me. And its a very sharp headache just on the sides of my head - I could take as many Advils, as I want but sometimes the ache starts to throb and it just compels me to put my head down . Then the fatigue , always always tired, body feels heavy - I have a few energy peaks but generally by 5pm, I just want to sleep or feel like Im waiting to sleep. Next is breathing which always kinda scares me although doctors have said its linked to anxiety. I develop shortness of breath much quicker than I used too- its as if out of nowhere I have to take a huge breath because the air in my chest feels stuck . Then chest pains, muscle spasms, and speaking in a monotonous dragged out voice . I hope it gets better for you though; I really do.","Then the fatigue , always always tired, body feels heavy - I have a few energy peaks but generally by 5pm, I just want to sleep or feel like Im waiting to sleep.",340,5,1

s_1673_863,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"I rolled over on to my right side, seeking optimal comfort under the oppressive softness and warmth of my heavy comforter. Letting out a sigh of content I curled up tighter, trying to squeeze every bit of warmth from this unforgiving room. Winter nights have always been the worst in this house. The draft that permeated the upper floors was almost unbearable at times, prompting the purchase of the extra thick bedsheets. One would think that there must be some sort of problem with the top floor, perhaps a lack of insulation, or improperly laid venting. The problem here is that I've had the house inspected several times by various different people. From furnace and duct work specialists to general contractors and so far no one has found anything of note. It was frustrating to say the least but luckily everything else about the house is great. I should probably just invest in a space heater and stop complaining to be honest. As the thoughts of of my house slowly wound down into peaceful nothingness, the hands of the sandman carefully wrapped around me, dragging me ever more quickly into his realm of slumber. Biology seemed to have a different idea though, and with my consciousness waning my bladder made a desperate plea. "" Seriously?"" I thought to myself ""Always at the worst times, I swear"". I grumbled audibly as I tentatively removed myself from my wonderful cocoon and stepped into the frigid landscape that was my bedroom. I grabbed a sweater that hung from the door and slipped it on, already shivering in the pale moonlight. Glancing at my alarm told me it was 12:26 am. I had been tossing and turning for nearly 2 hours. I've suffered from mild insomnia for years, so this wasn't anything new to me. However it didn't make it any more easy to leave my thermal sanctuary. As if sensing what I was doing my bladder let out an even more desperate cry, forcing me to nearly duck waddle as I made my way down the dark hallway to the bathroom. I flicked the light switch on, blinding myself in the process. Through squinted eyes I was able to make out the toilet and begin my business. My eyes had adjusted by the time I was finished, so I took a moment to inspect my face in the mirror as I washed my hands. My eye's were those of a man who was far too tired and cold, nearly dead in their stare. If I they weren't mine I'd probably be scared of eyes like this. I took a second to inspect the thin scar that ran across the bridge of my nose, a remnant of my childhood. I had apparently done battle with a coffee table when I was 5 and the coffee table won. "" I got a cool scar out of it at least"" I thought to myself. I finished my hands and flushed the toilet. This is my least favorite part of late night wanderings. I stood in the doorway, took a deep breath and turned off the bathroom light. Now I'm not a superstitious person, I'm not paranoid, I'm not one to jump at shadows. For some reason though, standing in total darkness waiting for my eyes to adjust, has always terrified me, even in my own home. When i was younger It was a real problem. I'd never go to the bathroom at night unless i absolutely had to, to the point where wetting the bed was a more preferred outcome. As I became older it did get better but even now at 23 i still get freaked out about late night lavatory visits. They say that the fear of the dark is simply the fear of the unknown and i believe that holds true. I'd imagine it's a primeval thing, dating back to when a shadow in the dark was likely a predator trying to eat you. The lack of predators in the urban sprawl doesn't comfort me though. When my eyes finally came into focus I started to make my retreat towards my downy fortress. My eyes deceived me though and i managed to stub my pinky toe, on the unseen door to the laundry room, which had been left slightly open. The pain was bad but i was too tired to do anything but grumble and shuffle back to my room. Slipping the sweater off, I crawled back into bed. I was beginning to drift off again when i heard it. A single muffled bump. Normally this wouldn't have really bothered me but I was already on edge from my recent expedition. I decided It was probably nothing until I heard another one a minute or so later. It was strange but likely just an animal on the roof. But it continued and my sleep deprived mind went to thoughts of Jeremy. This is what got me out of bed. Slowly standing up, I donned my sweater once more and stepped into the dim hallway for a second time. I made my way slowly down the hall, my eyes already keen in the darkness. I didn't want to turn on any lights lest I lose what night vision I had. I made it to the bathroom and listened. I heard the bump again, it definitely wasn't on the roof like I had previously thought. It seemed to be coming from downstairs. My stomach jumped into my chest. I lost all sense of self preservation and ran downstairs not caring who was listening. I made it to the second door on the left and swung it open, flicking on the light as i did so. What greeted me was extremely relieving. "" What are you doing Jeremy? Whats the matter?"" My son looked at me, a rather terrified and confused look on his face and then he ran over and hugged my leg. I picked him up, and held him tightly as he tried his best to explain what was wrong. He was a decent speaker for 3 but he seemed to be trying to say a couple different things at once. I calmed him down and eventually found out that he had heard a monster making noise upstairs. He said he didn't want to go up there so he tried banging on his wall to get attention. I smiled at that, which prompted and even more quizzical look from my son. "" Don't worry I was just up there, and If there were any monsters they must have run away scared"". Jeremy seemed relieved at that, but still seemed a bit shaken up. "" Do you want to sleep in our bed tonight?"" I asked , i got a small nod in answer. I carried him upstairs, showing him the lack of monsters firsthand, which calmed him down immensely. By the time i laid him in between my wife and I, he was already sound asleep. My wife rolled over a gave me a look, to which i responded ""Don't worry about it, just dealing with some monsters"". I climbed into bed pecked my wife and son on the cheek and drifted off.","I've suffered from mild insomnia for years, so this wasn't anything new to me.",1645,3,1

s_2035_91,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"My emotions have definitely come to the surface since quitting! I cry more easily for one. Before when I felt triggered by something I would immediately go smoke and it kind of stuffed my feelings down and relieved the anxiety I was feeling. Now, I have the urge to get up to smoke and I kind of dont know what to do with myself. I usually just get up and go out on the porch and get some sun and fresh air. Thats where I used to smoke so I have this urge to go out there. I have been feeling down on and off. But I just started back on Welbutrin which affects dopamine levels and is also used to quit smoking (under the name Zyban). So I have that helping me through this. Hopefully your depression is short lived and your brain will heal its pathways soon. Ive read on here that a lot of ppl seem to struggle for about 3 months. But everyone is different. Have you tried some light exercise, like taking walks out in the sun and fresh air? Exercise is supposedly just as effective as antidepressants! Some ppl really need the meds too though. I have started walking and Ive improved my diet. That definitely makes me feel better. Maybe try that and be patient with yourself. Your Dopamine pathways are screwed up right now but it should get better with time. If it doesnt, maybe talk to your doctor about an antidepressant even if its just short term to help you through this.",I cry more easily for one.,64,0,1

s_2890_305,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry I think when you're a twin you hear a lot more about this supposed twin telepathy. Not because it actually happens to you though, but because everyone *asks* if it does. Well, I don't think it did. As many times as we were pestered by other kids wondering if we knew each other's thoughts, we really never did. Well not more than the average person could know anyways. My name is Ashe, and my twin sister is named Willow. Not wanting to be part of the trend of rhyming names, or names with the same first letter, our parents decided we should be trees. They definitely aren't the worst names we could have ended up with, I've heard rumors that our grandmother suggested to name us Beverly and Bailey. I think I'd die of embarrassment if I had to deal with my family calling me Bev all the time. It just seems like a *mom* name, you know? Anyways, that's besides the point here. Willow and I were always kind of competitive with each other, even though I seemed to always be on the losing end. Actually, it's not even that *I* was competitive with her, it was that I wasn't allowed to be good at anything unless she could be too. She had to be better. She wanted all of the attention. I played soccer? She played it better. I got excellent grades? She'd take my work and either copy it, or pass it off as her own. There was no getting ahead of her. Sure, I knew I was slightly smarter than her, but being in the same classes didn't help. Her being everyone's favorite didn't help either. I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself. Everyone overlooked me. We may have looked identical, but everyone could tell the difference. Being better at everything made Willow stand out next to me. When we were sixteen things changed for a short time. We went to a party together, and that night I think I realized that my twin sister was truly *evil.* More than just sibling rivalry, she had to hate me. It hasn't been long enough for me to be entirely comfortable talking about the whole situation, but I'll do what I can. We were going to a party together, the kind you have to sneak out of your window while your parents sleep to attend. For once my sister wanted me to outshine her. She helped me get dressed, and put on my makeup. She made me look beautiful, while she dressed casually. It's like we had switched places in the mirror. I think that's what she wanted. We snuck out just after 11, a friends car was waiting by the road to take us a few streets over for the party. When we got there Willows ex kept pestering us. He stalked us around the party, and while Willow left me to go talk to other people, he somehow became convinced that I was her. At this point I was a few too many drinks in, and I thought it would be funny to play along. I kissed him, and by the time we ended up in a room alone I realized that I had made a mistake. I tried again to tell him that I really wasn't her, but he told me he didn't care anymore. It was enough that I looked like her. Things went downhill from there, and when I saw Willow peek her head into the room, I thought she had come to save me. She didn't though, she watched it all happen, and snuck away before he left me there broken. It fucked me up. I didn't know who to tell, my sister watched it all happen and never told a soul, so I did the same. I kept it quiet, I started writing my feelings in a journal, and I became incredibly depressed. It got to the point where my parents actually became concerned, and they took me to a therapist. Though I wasn't ready to discuss what happened the therapist seemed to help somewhat, it gave me an unbiased person to talk to. With my parents so concerned for me, I was actually getting more attention than Willow for once. It didn't last long. Within a month things went downhill. Willow seemed to decide that if I got to be depressed, then so did she. She stole my journal, told our parents that it was hers, and they panicked. They couldn't have their favorite daughter turning into the sad little thing I had become. She stole my tragedy, openly talked about what her ex had done to *her.* I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone the truth, I still wasn't ready to admit what he did to me. She didn't hold back though, and things only became worse. She started lying about me, she told everyone that I saw it happen and did nothing to help. The entire world was against me, and my parents pulled me out of therapy. They decided that my sadness was actually guilt over not helping my sister, and I didn't deserve to feel better. Life became hell, there was no escape. I got a new journal, I sunk deeper into my feelings, I started mutilating myself just so that I would feel something that wasn't *sadness.* No one cared at all. Though I had lived my entire life in my sister's shadow, this was worse. I was a pariah. Nothing I did couldn't somehow be turned against me. Being upset wasn't okay, none of my problems existed, I was branded the liar who was trying to steal Willows problems. They found out I was hurting myself, it must have been because Willow was doing it. Everything I did *had* to be because of her. Everyone believed that I was the one trying to steal her life, her pain. I couldn't be my own person. This went on until after we turned 18. The school year was almost over, it was all almost over. I'd be able to leave, finally be free. I could make my own life, I could finally be my own person. I couldn't handle the past though, I needed to do something so that I wouldn't be followed by it. I could only think of one option, I plotted out how I would do it for weeks. It took me awhile to get the courage, but I was going to kill myself. My entire existence mattered to no one, everyone was disgusted by what Willow had convinced them to think about me. When our parents found the body, they also found the journal. The journal with *Ashe* written across the front. It didn't contain much, just apologies and the details of a planned suicide. They seemed devastated, but at the same time relieved. Their shameful daughter had done the world a favor. They held me while I cried, everything would be different now. They never believed in all the issues that Ashe had, they never understood that her pain had been stolen and used against her. They would never know. I never wanted my sister's life, I wanted my own life. Now I'm the only one around to live for both of us. She took my life in spite, but she didn't realize how much of me she took by stealing my death. My name was Ashe, but my sister stole that last part of me when she collapsed on the bathroom floor holding my journal. I finally have my life back, everyone knows what happened to me. Everyone knows how hard my life was, and saw the pain I suffered through. Now everyone calls me Willow. [HF](<URL>)","I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself.",1520,6,1
s_2890_89,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"This Job Has Given Me More Than Just Money *Where do you see yourself in five years?* Happy maybe, or dead. It's a question I've been asked a lot, and I have never been quite sure how to answer it. There are things I *want* to do, there is so much of life I haven't experienced. Yet I couldn't pinpoint what to do. Often enough I feel entirely at a loss for what to do with myself, I mean, what's the point? Here I am at 19, working in perhaps the strangest and most secretive hotel ever to exist, because I really needed for there to be a point. I needed a way out of the life I'd found myself stuck in. Four years ago was when an abusive man made me realize my only option. I had to run. I had a friend who I'd known since elementary school who was several years older than me, lived in the U.S, and was already engaged with a baby on the way. They were just scraping by themselves since they were both barely 20, but they knew the extent of what I was living with and offered me a hideaway. It was the end of my freshman year of highschool, and I told my father about plans to *visit* some friends over the summer. He seemed to be fine with having me gone, but the weeks leading up to my departure were some of the worst. I used all the money I had left from babysitting to buy a bus ticket-- which was a small sum, since that's what happens when your father borrows your money for beer-- and packed my bags days before I was set to leave. The morning of my trip my father woke me up at 6am. I had to be out of the house and in the car within five minutes if I wanted to leave, he was not in a good mood. We drove at 90(Km) on a street that I believe was 30. I think we hit 140 on the highway. By 6:30 we were at the truck stop where the bus would be picking me up. Usually a 45 minute drive at the least. When I got out of the car, he peeled out of the parking lot, causing bystanders to stare. It was nearly four hours til my bus would arrive, I had no spare money to buy food from the truck stop, nor any food with me, and I sat at a picnic bench outside and waited with my single suitcase for hours. Thankfully my phone was working, and I spent the time texting my friends to tell them I'd see them in a few weeks. Those texts changed into goodbyes later when I was across the border and safe. I got on the bus and travelled to the biggest city in the country, where I met with my friend, Emily. She was a dual citizen, and planned to drive me from this city to her house. We got in the car and drove, stopping at the border to identify ourselves. Being under 16 I didn't need a passport to cross, but a birth certificate. They also asked if I had permission from my parents, since my friend was obviously not old enough to be my guardian. I actually had managed to get my father to drunkenly sign a note I'd typed up to give myself permission to go for a few weeks; He assumed it was a school form and didn't read it. We got across and back to Emilys house in a few hours of relative peace. I was finally in a place where my father couldn't follow due to his criminal past. Money was often tight, I couldn't work because I had no social security, and no one would pay me under the table within a reasonable distance. I had no car or license, and couldn't get one. Emily attended a local community college and her fiance worked, but it was just barely enough to cover the bills and cost of her classes. The process of becoming a citizen took awhile for her, she was lucky that she came here when she was older and had a better paying job before coming. Emily had a nice chunk in her savings by the time she crossed over, and it still took her over a year to become a citizen. I've been here for nearly five years now, I'll be twenty pretty soon. We've hardly got anything saved towards paying for my citizenship, and I constantly feel guilty that I can't help get things moving. Since I've been here they had their first baby, and now Emily is pregnant with their third. Since both of them are still trying to lead normal lives, I've been helping to take care of their kids and the house. Emily has managed to continue to go to school, though taking certain semesters off to care for her kids has definitely slowed down the already long process of nursing school. Her fiance, Jeremy, has been working a steady job all this time. It pays well, but with a growing family things can be pretty rough at times. I finished out high school here, because schools can't decline you based on citizenship apparently. I have a high school diploma, from an American school. That helped me not feel so useless for my first couple of years here, but since money is too tight for me to attend college as well I've been doing a lot of nothing for nearly two years. I just help around the house, spend time with Emily and Jeremy, and help with the kids. I've always wished I could do more. That's why yesterday when I got a text from a number in the same area code as me, that said there was a way that I could earn money without needing a social security number, I was more excited than wary. I assumed it was a friend who I had given my number to on Facebook while discussing my job search, and didn't bother asking who I was talking to. I figured I could do just about any job that would help towards becoming a citizen, finally attending college, and becoming someone real within the world. They ended up sending me an email to contact. I didn't hesitate to send in an email containing my nearly empty resume. I received a reply within minutes, asking me to detail my current financial situation and my reasoning for wanting the job. I explained how I had been told that I could be hired here without a Social Security number, and how I couldn't find anywhere else that would do so. I also told him why I needed the money, and vaguely described my living situation. He seemed very kind in his reply, letting me know that he could have someone pick me up to bring me in for a final interview, after I filled out their application form. I quickly filled out the form that was sent to me, slightly confused by some of the questions it contained. He gave another hasty reply, seeming pleased with my application he offered to have an employee come pick me up at three that afternoon to have our final interview by 5pm. He gave me some details of the job they wanted me for, and I was pleased that it seemed to be simple work. $40 an hour to do housekeeping for a hotel. $10 from my pay would be taken each week for the cost of having someone from the hotel driving me to and from work. All further details would be discussed during the interview. Emily arrived home at two, and I excitedly told her about the job offering. One of the emails told me that I should not reveal the name of the hotel that was hiring me to anyone, because they didn't want it being known that they would pay under the table. I told Emily this, and she didn't pester to know the exact details of my employment. At 3:10pm a truck pulled up in front of the house, a good choice to fit into the middle-of-nowhere area we lived. I told Emily I'd see her later in the evening, and set outside to introduce myself to the stranger in the car. I've never been the outgoing type, but I've been told that I'm always a really friendly person. I don't have many friends, but I've met many people and all of those first impressions seem to have gone well. The driver introduced himself as Tyler, an employee at the hotel, and he apologized for being late. He explained that he didn't drive a lot for the hotel, and he'd never picked up a passenger like me. He didn't ask me many questions, and didn't seem to be aware of the reason he was picking me up. Will you be driving me everyday? I asked him to break to silence of the drive. Everyday? He questioned back. For work? I'm going in for an interview, I told him. Ohhh, the word was dragged out, as though it was dispelling whatever other reason he had thought he was escorting me to the hotel, If we're on the same shift probably, your house is on the way from mine. I debated asking him what the he initially thought he was escorting me for, but instead I let the car fall into another moment of silence. I've never been the best at keeping a conversation going, but his voice soon filled the vehicle again. If you get the job, I can tell you it's an experience like no other. I can't tell you much, since you're not an employee yet, but Mister Smith will go over all the details with you, I'm sure, he paused to smile at me for a moment, Any idea what position you'll be working? Housekeeping, I replied distractedly, wondering about what sort of hotel this could be to provide experiences worth talking about, while being unable to talk about them. Ugh, he made a face of exaggerated displeasure, Better you than me, I couldn't clean up after strangers. I'd find it tedious. I shrugged, It's pretty much all I'm good at. His face was in an expression of apology when he glanced at me, I didn't mean anything bad by that, it's valid work. I smiled at him, not wanting him to worry over a comment that I honestly hadn't taken any offence with, I know, I was just saying. That's why it's a great job for me. He seemed relieved that he hadn't come off as rude, and we spent the rest of the ride cycling in between small talk and silence. It was pleasant, I felt comfortable and relatively confident about the job. Meaning that I didn't really feel confident whatsoever, but I'd choke those feelings down and attempt not to let my nervousness shine through during the interview. Tyler pulled up in front of the hotel, and I was astounded that such grandeur could exist in the heavily wooded area. The forest that surrounded must have been ancient, because the trees that filled it were taller than I could have ever imagined any trees to be. Somehow the hotel looked natural among the towering foliage, as though it was meant to be in this place. It was beautiful and remote, a perfect getaway. I felt at peace as I got out of the car, *almost* enough to ease my nerves over the rapidly incoming interview. Tyler directed me to head into the lobby and speak to someone at the front desk while he parked the truck with the other hotel vehicles. I entered the hotel to find a lobby as immaculate as the exterior, the hotel was truly extravagant, and I could almost understand why the application featured such odd personal questions. It brought the large paycheck into perspective as well, and defeated any wariness that may have been held deep within me. There was a girl with long, raven-colored hair, and shocking blue eyes who stood behind the front desk. Welcome to the Good Shade, I'm Dawn, how can I help you? She greeted cheerfully as I arrived at the desk. I squinted for a moment at her name tag, which quite obviously did not say Dawn. That was the only opportunity I've had so far to look at her name tag, but if I recall correctly it said *Alphaea I.C*. I'm not sure what that means, but it didn't really look like a name to me, so I dismissed it as some sort of labelling the hotel has for staff. I returned her smile, I'm here to see Mister Smith about a position here. She gasped excitedly, I knew you'd be here soon, right this way, he's waiting for you. With a glee filled smile she gestured to a door behind the front desk. I wasn't sure what she was so excited about, but as I walked towards the door I could swear that she *sniffed* me. I found myself slightly concerned about the mental health of the girl at the front desk, and wondered vaguely if people like her were the reason that the application contained such odd questions. A tall man sat behind a dark wood desk, and introduced himself as Mister Smith. He was the owner and manager of the hotel. He created all the rules and guidelines for the staff and guests, and he oversaw all that went on inside the hotel. He also personally dealt with all applications for employment, which apparently didn't happen often. Before any conversation about the position took place, I had to sign an agreement to keep everything confidential. Honestly, I wouldn't even know that posting here was an option if I hadn't seen [Tyler's post](<URL>) on here a while back. I've been reading the awful tales of the darkest moments in the lives of people for many years, but I never thought I'd be one of the people posting. That's besides the point though, I have to finish detailing what I experienced last night. After signing the form we began discussing the job. I'd be doing regular hotel housekeeping-- for the most part. My job would not always be a regular one, there was the possibility of my assistance being needed with guests, or I may end up requested by a guest for certain actions. I was fine with all of that. Some of the actions detailed deep within the contract seemed odd, but it was all well within what was worth it for the job and the money. This was the only job I could get, and it honestly didn't seem like a bad one. We arranged to have 30% of my pay deposited directly into Jeremy's account, after a quick phone call with him to confirm this was acceptable. That portion would be what I used to pay back Emily and Jeremy for housing me for free over the years. 60% would be deposited into a savings account that the hotel had provided me with. Another contract had to be signed there, but all Mister Smith did was make a phone call in private afterwards. The final ten percent would be put into a chequing account that came with the savings. That was the money I planned to spend freely, whether I used it to buy clothes, groceries, or help out with the bills when things were tight at home. My savings would first be going towards citizenship, then getting a cheap place for myself. I plan to stop being a burden on my friends as soon as I can, they have a growing family and shouldn't also have to deal with a nearly 20 year old woman living off of them. Once the apartment was in place and I had enough in my savings, I'd be able to work towards college. Living on my own would have me spending a portion of my cheque on rent, but if I manage to keep this job that won't be an issue. This job paid more than well enough for me to finally get myself out into the world. I suppose that I should have been concerned when he asked me to confirm my genetic background. When I replied that I was fairly certain that I was 100% human, he seemed skeptical. He squinted at me for a moment, and it made me nervous. * Why on Earth would you question whether I'm human or not?* Then things got really strange, he asked me if I would mind consenting to a blood test. I agreed, but it definitely freaked me out. I kept reminding myself that this was my only option. By the end of the meeting I had agreed to the requirements of the job, had my blood taken, and signed what may have been dozens of forms. I also found out that my first shift had already begun, and I would be spending my night at the hotel. I called Emily from the phone in the office to let her know that I wouldn't be returning until morning. I was about to leave the office when the girl from the front desk entered the room. She held out a plastic card to me, and I was shocked when I realized what it was. A debit card from a bank local to my area, it had my name on it and looked exactly like Emily's card from the same bank. Mister Smith assured me that this was a fully functional card, and that he had pulled some strings with a friend at the bank to create an account for me. As long as I was employed with the hotel they would be sure that I would face no consequences from possessing an American account before becoming a citizen, and Mister Smith would be glad to have his friend add my social security information once I become a citizen, so creating a new account and transferring the money would not be necessary in the future. I was beyond grateful as I left the office, for the job, the bank account, and the understanding that my boss seemed to express over my confusing situation. I was told to speak to Dawn so that she could give me the items I'd need to begin my shift. When I was once again facing the front desk, both Dawn and Tyler stood behind it smiling. Did you get the job? Tyler asked me. I smiled, I did actually, Mister Smith told me I needed to speak to Dawn before I get to work. That's great-- He stopped short to stare intently at the computer screen in front of him for a brief moment, --Sorry, I've been requested to a room. Are you coming, Dawn? She shook her head, I have to help our new friend meet with Rose, but-- she squinted at the screen for a moment, -- It's just my stupid brother, you'll be fine, she rolled her eyes as she stepped away from the counter. Tyler shrugged and walked off towards several sets of elevators, and I watched as he produced a key card and swiped it through a card reader before pressing the call button. As he got into the elevator I looked back to Dawn, who was pulling a piece of paper from a filing cabinet, then she walked back towards me. Read this, let me know if you have any questions, she stated simply. I took the paper and looked it over, some of it brought my concern back into full force. *Welcome to housekeeping at the Good Shade,*
*Your position is a key role in our hotel, as we are well known for how immaculately kept such a large establishment remains constantly. On request you may be provided with a brief map of the property, which explains some of the regulations about guests located in different areas of the hotel.* *Certain rooms require specific towels, sheets, blankets, soaps, etcetera. Please refer to the head of our housekeeping crew for a list of rooms and their requirements.* *At this point, you have already signed various contracts restricting you from speaking about any aspect of your job. This was included in the documents you signed, but we must reiterate that in the case of finding items that you consider to be suspicious, dangerous, illegal, evidence in a crime, or remnants of a crime, you are not to react as you would in a normal situation.* *Emergency services are unable to be contacted from or enter our establishment. We have medical staff who can deal with any wounded person(s) found in a room. We also have teams to deal with any person(s) found who may be deceased. Please refrain from touching any person(s), whether they be living or deceased. This also includes any other guests, and generally the other employees.* *If accidental contact is made at any point, please refer to the front desk for treatment of any negative side effects. Other than the items above, housekeeping here is relatively the same as everywhere else. Please remember that we take pride in immaculately clean rooms. Please refer to the head of housekeeping for concerns about anything found while working, and further details about the job.* *- A. Smith, Owner Manager*
I think it's hardly a question that anyone who read such a thing would be fairly concerned about what kind of hotel this truly was. I need the money though, and on the bright side, at least if I find a dead body I don't have to be the one to remove it. After reviewing that sentence, I realize that my life may have hit it's utter low. Once I get enough money though, I could put this all behind me. I have a chance to quit in three months according to the contract, and there were consequences that I didn't want to learn about for quitting before you had worked the allotted time. This place seems to be incredibly serious about the whole secrecy thing, and I think this subreddit might be part of the reason that the employees can handle holding it in around the rest of the world. I didn't bother asking Dawn any questions at that moment, I just steeled myself for the night ahead of me. She pulled out a key card and handed it to me with a smile. Head to floor U1, and Rose should be in the laundry room waiting for you. That's the storage floor. The strange label of the floor gave me pause. She smiled as though this was a charmingly innocent question that was often brought up, Mister Smith always forgets to tell the new employees, we actually have 50 underground floors. When we send you to a room with the label U in front of the number, it's underground. I nodded, I honestly had guessed as much when I'd first heard her announce the floor I needed to go to, but it was still a little surprising to know for a fact that this hotel has underground floors. What could have possibly motivated someone to build a hotel that had its majority of rooms below the earth? I thanked Dawn for her assistance, and headed towards the elevators. There was a handwritten message on the back of the housekeeping paper that I hadn't noticed until then, it said *Use the second elevator *
I glanced back towards Dawn and she gave me a small smile and wave, before turning to type something into the computer. I arrived in front of the second elevator, and I swiped the card I held through the reader as I had seen Tyler do. The call button lit up when I pressed it, and the elevator opened before me in less than a minute. I got to the correctly labelled floor and was in the laundry room too fast to calm my nerves about my first shift. There was a woman in there, maybe in her mid twenties. She was beautiful, tall and curvy, with honey-blonde hair spilling down to her waist. She turned to me as I approached, and she gave me a smile that warmed her ice-blue eyes. She straightened as she took in my appearance, and her sudden change in expression made it seem as though she sensed something was amiss. That expression quickly changed back though, and she introduced herself as Rose, the head of housekeeping. For my first night all she wanted me to do was two of the underground floors. Approximately ten rooms on each of those floors had been vacated earlier in the day and needed to be arranged for new guests. Around twenty rooms in one shift didn't sound bad. She told me which rooms needed certain things, and gave me a list that carefully inventoried every item that needed to be present in each room that I cleaned. She also explained to me the hotel protocol for cleaning various things, including blood. After all of the preparation I was finally ready to get to work. It was more than twenty rooms, but I didn't complain. I took a cleaning cart and headed off to the floor below me to begin. That floor consisted of mostly regular housekeeping tasks. I took my time, not wanting to be left with nothing to do halfway through my shift. After nearly three hours I finished 12 rooms on that floor. They were all pretty basic, each room was the same. I moved on to the next floor with around six hours left in the ten hour shift. The first few rooms went simply, I made beds and restocked towels. I vacuumed, swept, mopped, and wiped things down. As I progressed down the hallway I heard strange noises coming from occupied rooms. It ranged from crying, to screaming, to what seemed like some intense sexual activity. From one room I heard what sounded like chanting in a foreign language. All the strange noises put me slightly on edge, and I tried to push through the 15 rooms on the floor that I was assigned to clean. I got to the last room and found blood splatter in the shower, fresh enough to still be pooling in the tub. The sight made me dizzy, and I had to take a moment to catch my breath. It freaked me out, I wasn't sure how fast blood dried but I felt like I had narrowly missed seeing criminal activity. I cleaned out the tub using the methods Rose had described to me, and finished that room faster than any other. Or at least, I thought I did. I walked out into the hallway and noticed a dried smear on the wall that hadn't been there before, assuming it was blood I quickly cleaned it. I wasn't about to get in trouble because a murderous guest was running rampant through the hotel. I was afraid though, what if the person who caused this bloodshed was still nearby? I strode hastily towards the elevator with my cart in tow. I let out a breath that I didn't realize I was holding when I met Rose back in the laundry room. What took you so long? She asked as I put away the cart. I was confused by the question, I still had hours left in my shift. I looked at the clock on the wall and was surprised to see that my shift had ended thirty minutes prior. Somehow I had lost a lot of time. I explained to her what I found while cleaning, but she seemed unconcerned. She dismissed me for the day, and I went up to the lobby to find Tyler. He informed me that his shift didn't end for over an hour, but I could nap in the office on the couch while Mister Smith was gone. I took the offer, and awoke later to have Tyler escort me to the truck we had arrived in. As we got in the vehicle I noticed his nametag, *Tyler Stephens, H.S.*
What does H.S mean? Is that some sort of hotel label? I pointed towards the tag. He glanced at it and smiled, Kind of a hotel thing, they put your species on your nametag to help the guests. I was surprised. H.S is quite obviously homosapien, but what did Dawn's nametag mean? Was I truly working with people who weren't human? I didn't know how to respond with anything more intelligent than, *Oh, okay.* Tyler had just started the engine when I saw Dawn come running from the hotel. She stopped at my window and gestured for me to open it, and once it was down she handed me a small piece of metal. She told me it was my nametag, and I thanked her for delivering it. We drove away, and I found myself staring at the nametag. I wondered if I would fit in as an employee at this hotel. Perhaps most importantly, I'm wondering if the people here can answer a question while I'm employed. A question that Tyler had no clue how to answer on the drive. A question about what their blood test revealed, because I'm not sure why my nametag reads *Isabelle Lawrence, N.F.*
The last thing Tyler said to me before he dropped me off was this, You're going to see a lot of things that you've never expected, imagined, or wanted to see. If you think you've had a weird night already, you haven't seen anything yet. I had trouble going to sleep as the sun rose, I took the time to think about my life. *Where do you see yourself in five years?* How can I know, when I'm not even sure if I'm human anymore? -----

As a kid I knew I wasn't very pretty and didn't care but not looking like my mom and sister bothered me. People loved to point out how white I am, others would ask if I was adopted. I hated it.

During that time I also was developing an eating disorders due to stress of moving and whatnot as well as the fact that I am just prone to mental disorders. I had started cutting myself a couple years before that. But my anorexia lasted a while. The kicker is that while I started getting skinny and pretty (not that I was overweight before) my sister got pregnant and gained 50 pounds in her pregnancy.

No personality??! Cmon you're just beating yourself up for no reason at this point. I should have done electronic engineering. But I didn't. I should've gone straight into a masters program. But I didn't. I'm an engineer and not necessarily happy. How does going straight into a masters program help? You could be in the same situation with more debt. You need to be more rational about these negative thoughts your having. There're people my age who have children on purpose. Some of my friends have mortgages. Some of them are with the people they're going to marry. How does any of this matter? Children and spouses don't cure depression. All the things you listed could actually make you feel worse.

It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone. My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later. I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days.

Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me. I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though. No wonder I'm going to die alone. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter. I'm scared to sleep because I know if I lay down in bed, I'm just going to think awful thoughts and make myself feel worse than I already do.","I'm angry all the time, or depressed.",3400,0,1
s_356_158,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Just venting/ranting i guess. Waking up each day is one of my worst fears. I'm completely disappointed whenever i open my eyes each morning. I want to die, but i'm too much of a little bitch to kill myself. I'm only alive because i don't want to disappoint the people that i know. Every time i try to kill myself i fail. I always feel like i'm a failure. I can't even take my own life, and i know it's pointless to try anymore. Hurting myself is only a way to feel something other than this depression. Starving, cutting, and depriving myself of sleep are the only ways i can hurt myself. I am scared to sleep, due to the fact that i constantly have nightmares about my life. I can help but just fell worthless/useless, like i have no reason to stay here. I don't even understand why i'm here. I have no motivation towards life or any activities that use to bring me joy in the past. The joys i felt within these activities were so artificial that it just sickens me to try to participate in any of them. I just don't understand why i am even alive. Everyday is a struggle to try and not end up dead. If i could die without disappointing everyone around me i'd be able to die peacefully. I deserve to die a very painful death. The hatred that i have for myself is sometime unbearable. I just want to slam my head against a wall until i can no longer think, or just jump out into busy traffic. Just something that will be painful. It sounds weird i guess, but a painful death is what i feel I deserve. I have basically no hope in my future and believe that i am heading nowhere in my life. My life is a disgrace and i can never change. I make up all sort of excuses or outcomes to everything so i can just stay home and waste away. I do not want to be put on any medication because if i do achieve happiness, i do not want it to be artificial from a pill. I've lived most my life around people doing drugs (Brother addicted to pills and many deaths within close friends). I know it's probably my best route but i just cant live with myself that way. But that's suggesting that living like this is any better. I have been getting out a bit more which is a little nice, but i just feel so fake. I want to express this to the people around me, i guess for help. Even with all the things i said in this post, i want to live a happy life. A life where i can say that i atleast feel okay, respect myself, and overall don't shut out the people i love and my friends. i fell as uif i'm losing myself and them. i'm just drifting away, and i cant find a way back. I'm just so paranoid of everything and everyone. This is the first time i've let this out in about 3 months. I just let it build up in myself until i can't take it. I know that this is just a huge mess of a post, but i just needed to let it out. There is stuff i most likely missed but i'm just overwhelmed by everything. I'm sorry for my bitching and everything. i just can't explain it well. I hope that i do not wake up tomorrow morning.

s_473_485,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"Actually, I *am* extremely paranoid in regards to unplanned pregnancy. You can thank pro-choicers for instilling a zero tolerance of risk in me in regards to this. After all, I heard pro-choicers complain many, many times about contraception and sterilization failure. However, unlike these pro-choicers, I simply don't have the option of abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, which in turn means that I absolutely cannot risk an unplanned pregnancy in the first place. Also, abstaining from sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me. However, in addition to this, I did say that I am interested in using female hormones and reducing my sex drive, both of which is accurate. After all, I have heard (from both trans-women and trans-men) that female hormones make one more emotional, which is certainly something that I want. Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to. Plus, I have heard that female hormones increase the length of one's orgasm and make one body sexually aroused in a different way, both of which I would certainly like to try out. Also, I would like to have a more feminine face so that I would develop a more androgynous appearance. In addition to this, though, I absolutely hate all of my body hair and facial hair and thus want to permanently get rid of as much of it as possible. This hair makes me feel dysphoric and I would prefer that all of it simply disappeared and never grew back. After all, I would like to have a more feminine and ""clean"" appearance as well as to cross-dress at times.","Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to.",935,1,1

s_2986_448,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"everyone hates having me around them
As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong. If they didn't like you, they'd tell you to fuck off to your face.","I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done.",116,6,1

Since I was young my life would jump forward every time something terrible would happen to me. The first time it happened was when I was 6 years old. That is the year that my father was involved in a hit and run. I remember wanting to cry, but before I knew it I felt like all of my grief was gone. I felt at piece, but I felt extremely different. My mother came in my room and told me to get ready for school. Somehow I knew where all of my clothes were, but they felt like they were much too big to fit me. When I put my shirt and pants on I realized they fit me perfectly. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, but when I walked in I saw my own reflection. I was a lot taller than before, and my face looked a lot more different. When I ate my breakfast my mother dropped me off at a middle school. After 30 seconds of confusion I suddenly knew which class to go to, and who my friends were. I knew that I was in 7th grade since I was now 12. I knew that I had a bully, but he was never really that bad. His name was James, and he was always yelled at by his mother when she picked him up from school. My friends name was Brian and he was obsessed with his music. Everything was okay with my life for the next two years. I met my first crush, but she never liked me back. Brian and I grew closer every day since we had the same classes, and James ended up moving away. Everything was fine until my 14th birthday when my grandfather had a heart attack in our living room while I was blowing out my candles. After my mother received a call telling her that my grandfather didnt make it I started to cry. Just moments later I open my eyes to find myself sitting at a red light. I looked to my left expecting to see my mother driving, but found a steering wheel in front of me instead. That is when I had my first meltdown. I screamed at the mirrors that showed a face of a grown man, and I punched the steering wheel until my hands filled with pain. I looked outside the car window when I managed to calm down and realized that everything was different. I knew I was in the same city I always lived in, but there were stores I never even heard of. The park I used to go to all of the time was torn down and replaced with a mattress store. When I heard the car behind me honking I started to drive to my house. I dont know how I knew how to drive, but somehow I knew what to do and it felt completely natural. I got to my house to see an old lady sitting outside of the house. When I approached her to ask her if she were lost I was struck with the realization that it was my mother. Fragile and old, but still sitting there with the smile she always had for me. She asked me how I did on the first year of college and I numbly told her that I received all As and made it to the Deans list. I told her I was feeling sick and she told me to go to my room with a worried look on her face. When I got to my room I sat on my bed and began to remember everything that happened the last 7 years. Brian moved away when I was 13, and my favorite math teacher was found dead and lying on his desk completely still. He was dead for 8 hours before they found him. Not much happened afterwards. I graduated high school and went to my first year of college. The girl that I had a crush on is now my girlfriend. We havent had sex yet, but we both decided to wait until we were married.

We decided that the next September would be the best time for us to get married to get ourselves financially and emotionally prepared. Three months before our wedding my fianc passed away in a hospital. Knowing what would happen and the depression of her dying hit me at once and I unwillingly started to cry. I then found myself sitting in a coffee shop drinking a regular iced coffee. I look around to see where I am and found myself in the city I grew up in, but this time everything was different. People have started to look lifeless and uninterested with whatever they were doing. A baby was sitting at the table next to me just staring at me without any type of emotion. The mother took a look at me and said What the fuck are you looking at? I was blown away not by her statement but by how monotone she said it. I turned around and sat silently. I know that I am now 32 and I befriended James when he moved next door to me. The fact that he bullied me when we were so young did not affect how close we ended up getting. Two years after we became friends James was found in his living room with his intestines wrapped around his head and his organs spread around his body. Before I start remembering anything else I ran to my mothers house to make sure she was still alive. When I was 3 houses away I saw that my mother was rocking back and forth in her favorite chair outside. I go up to her and try to hug her, but she pushed me off and resumed rocking. I looked at her, but she refused to turn my way. When I turned her to face me I fell back onto the ground. Her face was the same but her lips were placed in a frown that immediately told me she hated everything about me. Her eyes were pure black as she said Dont fucking touch me again if you want to keep your hands. It was monotone, but it made me start to shake in fear. I went three streets over to my house and I laid in my bed for the next three days trying to figure out what the hell was happening. After three days I ran out of food so I went to the store. Again, everyone is expressionless and just going through the motions of shopping. One person was lying on the floor acting like he was walking. I stared at him for a couple of minutes thinking of a way to help him, but a lady hit him with the cart and started to drag him away. I decided right then and there to just live my life as if nothing was different. I got another job as a salesman and nothing happened for the next 5 years. After five years I decided to revisit my mother. I drove there and pulled into her driveway. She was still rocking on her chair and I walked up to her. I grabbed her shoulder and lifted her head thinking she just drifted off, but her head fell off her neck and into my hands. I screamed and dropped her head and it rolled to the side of my foot. I look down and see that her face is littered with holes all across her face. Maggots were going in and out of the holes and I turn around and go to my car. I start to cry and I know that I am about to lose even more of my life. I woke up and found myself in a chair. The chair that is in front of the computer I am posting this on now. To tell you all that I remember everything now. About how I poisoned my math teachers apple I gave him at five pm after he tutored me. I dont know why I did it, but I was tired of seeing people I cared about dying all around me. I remember slicing Jamess stomach open and ripping out his intestines and wrapping them around his face. I took out his organs and spread them all around him. They never found his heart because I buried it beside the tree we would always sit at and drink beers together. I am just tired of seeing people dying all around me, and I dont know why people have stopped showing emotions. I dont know why my mother was dead for so long without anybody alerting the police or even an ambulance. All I know is that I am not going to lose any more of my life.

I grabbed her shoulder and lifted her head thinking she just drifted off, but her head fell off her neck and into my hands. I screamed and dropped her head and it rolled to the side of my foot. I look down and see that her face is littered with holes all across her face. Maggots were going in and out of the holes and I turn around and go to my car. I start to cry and I know that I am about to lose even more of my life. I woke up and found myself in a chair. The chair that is in front of the computer I am posting this on now. To tell you all that I remember everything now. About how I poisoned my math teachers apple I gave him at five pm after he tutored me. I dont know why I did it, but I was tired of seeing people I cared about dying all around me. I remember slicing Jamess stomach open and ripping out his intestines and wrapping them around his face. I took out his organs and spread them all around him. They never found his heart because I buried it beside the tree we would always sit at and drink beers together. I am just tired of seeing people dying all around me, and I dont know why people have stopped showing emotions. I dont know why my mother was dead for so long without anybody alerting the police or even an ambulance. All I know is that I am not going to lose any more of my life. Please dont get close to me, because I will try my very best to hold onto the last few years I [have] (<URL>).","I remember wanting to cry, but before I knew it I felt like all of my grief was gone.",333,0,1

s_84_60,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I never met my father. In the past, I struggled often because I always see little girls holding fathers' hands and I get extremely upset/jealous a bit, maybe. Then I would get really angry at times. I wasn't really handling it well, growing up. I was also very fragile because I kept losing family members and friends (they died) around me. So it was difficult for my mother to be able to tell me. She wanted to wait until I get older; when I'm more mentally and emotionally prepared for the big, full story about my father. I was 24 years old when I found out. Father's Day rolled around in June 2013. Then I began to wonder about my father again. I haven't thought about him for a couple of years until for some reason, I wanted answers. I felt ready to know what kind of father he was. I researched, trying to find answers and I ended up finding his death certificate along with my half-brother's signature and phone number (I didn't know I had half-siblings). Sadly I found out he passed in February 2010. I was disappointed because I had planned on contacting him and try to get to know him and hope to meet him in person. But I finally got in contact with my half siblings (one half brother and one half sister) I never knew until two years ago and they told me many stories about him. Most of the stories weren't good, hence is why my mother protected me my whole life from not knowing what kind of father he was (he had a serious problem with alcohol and he was involved in drugs). So my mom finally told me her story and everything made sense from there. Even if I had meet him in person, I will end up feeling disappointed, seeing how my father turned out. I learned the hard way, so for me, it's better that I know what kind of person he was and I would be better off without him in my life. He wasn't a good person, especially to my half siblings. They had it really rough, growing up around him and especially when he ran out on them multiple times and is good at disappearing. He was no father figure. Regardless with the struggles, growing up, I turned out fine. I wouldn't be the person I am today. I look up to my grandfather, as if he's my father. I love him dearly. I love my family.

The room the four of us had chosen for training held the shape of a long and flat storage tank. Very similar to the space the Yngtaks had been held in, it could have supported our full thousand men, but it was one of dozens of such unused spaces and nothing had been inside it when we'd found it. It gave me the distinct sensation that I was inside an empty airplane hangar. Closer than those distant walls, though, my gaze bored into the upright metal plate before me. I called forth memories of those I lovedand, wrapped in those energies, gave the smooth chrome a solid punch with my gloved hand. While Celcus and Sampson stared, Flavia moved forward on her crutches to study the silvery fist-print. "" It's hot,"" she declared, pulling her finger back quickly. "" Probably from the stress on the metal itself."" She turned her head and narrowed her eyes at my undamaged knuckles. "" It's not just strength. You'd have to be more durable as well to not break your hand doing that."" It was rare that I felt this way. I was not immune to fear or anticipation, but, at that moment, I was actually *nervous.* What would they think of me? Asking them to accept that I romantically loved each of them had been harrowing enough, but now something even stranger was happening to me. Sampson clenched a fist and tensed his bicep to emphasize his thought. "" You do that by thinking of the qualities *we* possess?"" Honesty had not failed me in the caves. I decided that I needed to tell them everything now that I had told them anything. "" Well, for that punch, mostly thoughts of you."" Quickly seeing the confusion on their faces, I elaborated, ""When I need to be smart and analytical, I think of you"" I looked to Flavia. "" and when I need the self-awareness to balance more than one of these traits at once, I think of *you.*"" My tall man met my gaze with growing understanding. Celcus sank into thought. "" So you take on the strengths of those around you. Is it possible this is just a psychological effect? Maybe you can do these things because you believe you can."" Sampson gave a proud chuckle and raised a hand toward the damaged metal plate. "" You think *that's* just a product of belief?"" ""Human beings have been known to exceed their limits under extreme stress,"" Flavia mused. "" And of course we were trained to call upon those more costly layers of endurance at will. That may have helped her reach this place, but, no, this is beyond adrenaline factors. If she'd broken her hand with that punch, I'd have considered it likely, but no amount of stress can make bones and skin hardier."" My gaze kept jumping to each of them as they spoke. My fate was in their hands in a very unique and personal way. What if they chose to hate or fear me? What if
""Has anyone felt a drain during the events in question?"" Celcus asked, emerging from his deeper thoughts to look us in the eyes. "" Venita's described a handful of miracles in which she drew upon our strengths, but I don't recall feeling weakened during those moments."" Flavia froze halfway to speaking before reconsidering her words. "" I hadn't thought of that."" Looking down to spend a moment recalling, she then continued: ""I didn't feel weaker, either. ""Then that means she's not taking something from usshe's instinctively restructuring her own biology on the fly. Where would that energy come from?"" Taking a moment to study my face, she said in our formal dialectwhich we had not been able to use in quite some timea small modified phrase of wonder. The saying was normally *it is beyond belief, but my eyes prove it*; her statement was closer to, ""You are amazing."" My cheeks burned as I became acutely aware of their eyes upon me. That heat was matched only by the furnace in my heart. Desperate to shift attention away, I said, ""Energy? There's a sort of colored fire that burns in me."" Flavia took that in stride and moved closer on her crutches. "" I pointed to my heart. ""And what color?"" I wasn't sure why I found her line of questioning surprising, but I also realized that she couldn't see or feel it the way I could. "" She moved very close, as if in an attempt to see the fire through my very eyes. "" What *kind* of blue?"" Cheeks warming again due to her nearness, I gulped away a catch in my throat and offered, ""Lighter than cobalt, darker than cyan. Maybe azure to turquoise depending on intensity."" ""No hints of purple or green?"" I shook my head. She blinked, took that answer, and moved away while thinking. Celcus asked, ""Should we tell Septus? It doesn't feel right doing this without him."" ""I haven't known him as long as you,"" Sampson countered, ""But that likely makes me more objective. Anyone who listens to Conrad can't be fully trusted. This is too big. Too important."" My embarrassment at receiving personal attention faded in favor of my strategic senses. "" I think Conrad already knowsor at least suspects."" ""Yes,"" Flavia said from ten paces away while facing the empty distance of the white-lit hangar. "" He noticed you almost immediately, and his focus has only increased. I think he knew something was different about you from the moment your hand let us into his medical facility."" She turned around suddenly on her cast-clad leg. "" This has to be why your hand gets access from these places! Perhaps your biology reacts to what the system is looking for, or maybe there's some other element in you that only"" She froze. Celcus and Sampson were thinking it, but I was the one who asked, ""What?"" ""It's you,"" she breathed, staring at me. "" That thing Conrad said. The Sixth Millennial."" I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be set apart from my family. "" Flavia hobbled forward. "" What would the Machine Empress design her systems to look for in her absence if not the one thing that nobody else could replicate? A spark of some sortor a flame."" The words struck me like a hammer, and I lost all sense of where I was as I removed my glove and stared down at my own hand. I could see and feel blue fire moving along the nerves of that limb, palm, and digits; I could clench that energy and gather it up to strike, defend, or transform. It was emotionthe energy of emotion released from the mental realm and set ablaze in the physical. I still wore both my arm braces, but I doubted I needed the therapeutic one any longer. The multi-tool had become an extension of me, while the brace for my formerly broken arm had reached the end of its usefulness. There was someone else who needed it more. Carefully unclicking it and removing it, I handed the arm brace to Flavia. "" For your broken arm. Let's get that cast off."" She seemed taken aback by the gift. "" You don't need it?"" ""I don't think so. Not anymore."" ""Then forget the arm,"" she said with excitement. "" I'll use this thing on my leg so I can finally walk without crutches again."" Celcus asked, ""It can be resized like that?"" Already lifting her uniform's pant leg and cutting with her combat knife, Flavia used a term we had learned from the Vanguard: ""Duh."" We helped her remove the cast completely, and nobody mentioned the rather odious release underneath. The automatic systems inside the brace adjusted quickly to encircle, clamp, and support in the right places, and she stood with a mixed sigh. "" Hurts a little, but not with bone-pain. I think I'm just lucky it wasn't a worse break."" ""I would have given it to you sooner if I'd have thought it could be used on your leg,"" I told her, genuinely apologetic. How could I have failed to think of that? Her injuries had been sustained saving my life! My leg needed time to heal, and we've still probably put it on a little early, but I'm willing to trade some pain for mobility that might keep me alive in the coming days."" Celcus and Sampson both agreed with that, and the three of us watched as Flavia limped around the empty hangar with an exuberant smile. Raising her good arm, she aimed her pistol at the far wall a few times, testing her stance. "" I am half a warrior again."" ""Just half?"" Celcus called over with humor. ""Half an Amber soldier is more than enough."" For the next half an hour, my newly mobile beloved ran me through my paces like I was a first-year cadet, and, in some sense, I wasonly this academy was my own changing mind and body. At first, I was just happy that the people I loved accepted whatever this was, but then I, too, began sharing their excitement. Clicking her wrist-watch and comparing that number to our measurements of the hangar, she declared in Empire units in case Vanguard soldiers overhead us: ""Twenty one point one kilometers per hour. Not bad, but clearly a normal speed for a fit female our age. You weren't the fastest of us, either."" She readied her watch again. "" This time, think of Porcia. I set off around the lap we had demarcated with my thoughts focused on the fleetest of our family. She was gone, but her essence remained in my memories, and I could feel Septus' love for her keeping her with us as well. Celcus shouted; Sampson clapped once in surprise. I ignored their reactions in favor of reliving the adrenaline of the run I'd made against Conradand the lap was over before I could even really register beyond that. Flavia lowered her wrist-watch. "" Panting, I asked, ""What was the speed?"" She answered slowly, as if haunted. "" You didn't run the whole lap."" ""Of course I did."" I gasped for air as I regarded the course. "" I took each corner."" I took cues from my beloved men. "" Celcus and Sampson saw me run the whole thing."" Flavia accepted their nods, but still shook her head. "" You did go fast. Nearly double. I'd guess thirty-five to thirty-seven kilometers per hour. Amazing speed matching some of the best Amber sprintersmale ones, in fact. But *you didn't run the whole lap.*"" Confused and increasingly unhappy, I could only tell her, ""I don't understand what you mean."" She didn't seem to be able to blink. Her blue eyes remained on me; glinting moisture brimmed. "" I don't understand either, but you've done it once before."" ""Come on now,"" Celcus said, stepping between and breaking our line of sight. "" I saw her take each corner. How could she have turned four times but not run the whole lap?"" She gripped her forehead and turned away. "" I think maybe I'm just tired. I'm going to go rest in my room."" As I recovered my breath and watched her leave, I realized that I had seen through her eyes before and thus had some idea what was bothering her. She saw the world in a flurry of connections; a spider web of logistical axes bound by colored sums of a thousand hues and countless possible moments refracted like light through a prism made of time. She had never told anyone this, though I'd somehow drawn that aspect of her to me and seen through eyes tinted with her perspective when I'd raced Conradbut I myself had been the one thing I had not been able to observe. What had she seen in me with her unique vision that had disturbed her so? ""Yeah, time for a break,"" Sampson said, heading off as well. Only Celcus and I were left, and he asked as casually as he could, ""You and Sampson have fun last night?"" Snapped out of one frame and into another, I immediately replied, ""Yes,"" before thinking better of it. "" Well, we went for a walk. Does that... bother you?"" He tried to smile, but his answer was serious. "" I just hope you realize you're going to have to make some decisions soon. Let us know what you feel so that we don't have the wrong expectations."" What *did* I feel? I'd just taken off my arm brace, and that gave me the words. "" To deny any of you would be like cutting off one of my limbs. I can't do it."" His awkward shrugging and the masked pain on his face nearly broke my heart. He asked, ""Do you still feel the same about me?"" I did my best to convey everything I felt for him through an upwardly aimed kiss; my tall man had needed that, and he left with a lighter and reassured step. He was not wrong. I knew that I would have to do something soon. I'd been hoping the coming battle would delay personal decisions, but it was our instructors had told us: life doesn't stop for war. On my own journey through the halls, I remained quiet and brooding, but I could certainly feel the wordless attention of passersby. Human and Yngtak alike had seen me involved with the impossible, and I suspected Conrad might have been preaching something about me. Worse, I had no makeup to dull my appearance like I usually did back home, and I felt rather naked. One of the unpaired Vanguard men tried to stop and talk to me with a grin, but I made a polite excuse and practically ran away. Why did people have to look at other people that way? I just wanted to be an unremarkable part of a group. That way
That way I would never be alone. If I never took a personal risk, I would never risk losing the group, and I would never have to feel like I had felt *back then*. My feet no longer took me forward. Frozen in the middle of the hallway, I became aware of a fear that had likely been holding me back my entire life. I had not known myself. I had not had personal courage. I had not had the support and love I'd neededuntil now. My grandfather was a wonderful man, but he had not been able to fill the roles of an entire family. Now I had siblings in Trajan, Larentia, Paulinus, and Septus; an older sister in Caecilia; beloveds in Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia; a friend in Noah; andstrangest of all for me to recognizetwo crucial figures that fulfilled two very different but highly linked roles. Conrad approached down the hall as I stood waiting; he waved off his three lieutenants and they continued on, leaving us alone. He stood in silence, intrigued, until finally asking, ""Patience is not one of my virtues. Out with it girl."" As strange as it felt to consider this man as a partial filler of the missing role of father in my life, I had to say it: ""You've been trying to push me to improve, haven't you?"" His flat lips curved into a smile. "" I'll admit that, yes."" So it was true. I felt numb as I probed further. "" His head had gone from military near-baldness to hosting a short layer of brown hair in the time that I had known him; he ran his hand once through this now as he considered me with an only mildly unkind snicker. "" Do you think it's coincidence that the Sixth Millennial walked up to my door in humanity's hour of greatest need? Me, the one man above all others who knew the Fifth inside and out?"" So that, too, was true. I took a moment to breathe and guess at all the things I did not know because I had been raised not to ask questions. Darkness and light both had been glimmering outside the narrow purview of my personal concerns. How *dark?* "" Tell me all this isn't just to challenge me."" ""Not all of it, no,"" he said wryly at first; his smirk abruptly fell into dead seriousness. "" But I did send the signal to resurrect my wife because of you."" Cristina's desperate *why now?* echoed in my ears, and I took a step back. "" You""
""I suspected you from the very beginning,"" he continued. "" But I knew for certain when you helped me lift that door and free the Yngtaks. Not only did the energy you released heat the entire hallway full of water, I swam back there after and found your handprints on the bottom of the door. The outline of your fingers in *solid metal.*"" I couldn't deny it to him or to myself, not after what I'd done in secret only an hour before. The agenda behind this, though, had to be darker than I could imagine. "" You'd wake the monster behind the spheres just to spite me?"" He shook his head sadly. "" Look around you, Venita. These facilities were built to hold thousands, or even tens of thousands, not one woman. While I lost myself in dreams and nightmares, merciless boredom and hollow wonder eternal, Gisela built an entire empire for a people that exiled her long ago. More than that, she developed the technology for resurrectionDeath defeated! Truly slain!but then set the system not to bring her back unless I desired it, unless I came out of my eon of ennui and wanted to see her again. This was always a woman, not of evil, but of strong emotion. Whatever she may have become over centuries of solitude, she will never be a monster, just a worthy opponent."" The facilities. They'd been built so absurdly large. I'd never understood it. I'd wandered the floors, explored their labyrinthine depths, and marveled at the redundancy. I didn't trust Conrad, but I trusted that assessment of these factories and hospitals. They'd been built all over the region for capacity far beyond the needs of one lonely exiled Empress. "" But we're set to attack her main fortress."" He nodded carefully. "" We've been sending teams ahead with vehicles, supplies, and pallets of gear. They still can't come back until we win the day, but they *can* stock the million soldiers already laying siege. I've told them to spread the word that The Machine Empress of Mankind is about to resurrect."" A shiver of confusion ran through me. "" Have I misread you? Have you done all this with good intent?"" ""You misunderstand."" His smile became subtly mocking. "" They'll take it as an urgent omen of doom, not as a relief that this will all be over when she wakes up and turns off the artificial intelligence defense forces. They're making a grave error at my behest, and they'll deeply regret what happens after."" I stepped away with abject horror. Conrad's smile deepened as the full weight of what was happening hit me. We'd made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost had been our inevitably coming across and waking our immortal Imperator. My world had made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost would be a war with what the others had called a force on level with a god. The Fifth Millennial, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind, would easily destroy our Amber Worlds if so enraged. We'd been barely surviving trips across small portions of her realm. What could possibly stand against her in outright war? ""Yes,"" he said quietly as passersby approached. "" Things are going to be very hard for you shortly, but I think you'll rise to the task. If not, at least the battles will be entertaining as hell."" Acknowledging the passing soldiers, he nodded and headed away, completely unperturbed by our conversation. Don't panic. If my father figure was a manipulating bastard, then I needed his opposite. Bursting into her room after a mad dash, I shouted, ""Cristina!"" She looked up from her handheld tablet device. "" What's wrong?"" Hitting the button to slide the door closed behind me, I told her everythingthe testing, my discoveries, Conrad's tauntingand she listened and nodded along, unsurprised at any of it. "" Sit down, Venita."" I had never had the spotlight so directly focused on me by the course of events before, but my panic began to fade as I sat on the floor next to the bed and she began braiding my hair like she had that day at the river. ""Conrad told you what he told you for a reason,"" she told me with calm focus as she layered my hair back and forth behind my head. "" He's being both honest *and* manipulative. That's what makes his moves so effective. If he was lying, we could just find the truth, or even ignore himbut I have no doubt he believes what he's told you. Furthermore, he's calculated that revealing his intentions furthers his goals. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said anything."" Taking a deep breath and focusing my sight on the opposite metal wall, I asked, ""So he wanted me panicked? Wanted me distracted?"" ""I don't think so. It sounds like he's purposely given you fair warning. He wants you to grow stronger and face off against the Machine Empress. We can only speculate as to why, but, for the moment, our agendas align. We should work on getting you stronger."" She tugged down a few times before resuming. "" In the meantime, our mission will be to insert ourselves in the chain of command at the siege. * Somebody* from the Amber Worlds is in charge, despite the million men at large not publicly knowing."" ""Noah can sense Amber people,"" I told her. "" Or, rather, he *can't*, so he can pick them out of a crowd."" That's perfect. When the offensive begins, we'll join the tide, but we'll move to find the Amber soldiers and lie our way into the chain of command. After all, you *are* from Amber Three, and we'll know so much they'll have no choice but to believe us. The inability to get home means they won't be able to confirm with their headquarters any more than we will. Then we'll call off the attack."" All the terror that Conrad had instilled in me was gone. It was a solid plan. "" It might actually work."" ""It will."" She began working the longer ends of my braid. "" Right now, it sounds like you've got other things to worry about. Romantically, I only ever loved one person. Saw him in those Kansan wheat fields in his soldiering gear and decided he was it. But you've got yourself into a very tough situation. A team can't go into battle with confusion or pain between its members. And who knows who'll be part of the coming twenty percent? You have to live and love while you can."" She stopped just short of finishing my braid, and I guessed she was thinking of her lost husband. ""They calculated a twenty percent loss rate for the offensive?"" I asked, turning my head to the side to look up at her. ""No,"" she murmured. "" Twenty percent survival rate."" For the second time that day, true dread snaked its way around my heart. "" Twenty percent? * One in five?*"" There were five of us left in my squad! What if I was the only one who lived? What if all the
She snapped back to awareness and tied the end of my braid, finishing it. "" Don't let it get to you. It's just an estimate based on an incomplete model. We'll survive. We're not going to bear the brunt of those losses, remember? Our mission is orthogonal. And I would never send you into a murderous slugfest like that. The day is never won solely because of guns."" ""They sure help, though."" Pushing the dark snake away from my heart thanks to her calm confidence, I frowned. "" How do I choose?"" She let me up, and stood to walk me out. "" That's up to you. Nobody else can tell you how to live."" After activating the door and peering left and right, she told me, ""It's clear. Nobody saw you. I'm concerned he may have provoked you into running straight to the leader of the secret opposition faction, but, if you did have a tail, you lost them."" That brought a smile back to my face. "" I do run pretty fast these days."" She pushed me on my way. "" And don't worry. We'll survive what's coming."" I made it decently far away from her quarters before anyone saw me; meanwhile, I became preoccupied with the choice ahead. How could I possibly refuse what I felt for any of my three beloveds? Was it as simple as choosing the one whose potential loss most terrified me? That seemed like an odd thought in many ways. Something vital would be cut from me if I lost any of my threebut something vital would be cut from *them* if I remained vague and indecisive. While wandering the halls, I heard the words: ""It's better than *nothing!*"" I was walking along the second floor subsection C toward Sampson's quarters when a prickling along my skin stopped me in place. Without any other warning, two bloodied men in unrecognizable clothes fought hand-to-hand past the T-junction ahead. Shouting and punching one another, they were definitely engaged in a real and vicious fight. I only got a good look at oneand even then I saw only black hair and fierce eyesbut I absolutely heard him yell, ""The way *you* run things maybe!"" The two combatants moved beyond the end of the hall and out of sight. Dashing forward, I looked left and right down the junction, but they were nowhere to be seen. Had they fought around a corner or into one of the nearby rooms? I heard nothing, and the hallway was silent. To quote my Vanguard friend Sol: what *the hell* had that been? The hair on the back of my neck remained charged as I stood in that silent hall. I had the distinct impression of water flowing back into a hole and sealing it up; or of a plane flying over, full of lives that were crossing close by but which would never interact with mine. ""Venita,"" someone called, and I turned to see a doctor I recognized approaching. "" Did I hear right that you and your friends cut off Flavia's leg cast?"" Is everything alright?"" He came close and gave me a strange look. "" You know people don't normally do that kind of thing themselves. They usually get a doctor."" Some of his past comments and suspicions came back to me, and I had the sudden notion that he was somewhat cognizant of our differences from the rest of the Vanguard. "" Oh, um, we didn't want to bother you."" ""Is that so."" He took in a long draw of breath through his nose and let it out over the course of several seconds. "" Well, bother me in the future. It's why I'm here."" ""Of course. Thank you."" I watched him head on further down the hall before I resumed my course. Rather than head to Sampson's room, I chose my own, and I closed the door to find myself in rare solitude I had not experienced since that night at Conrad's medical facility. This factory had rooms for thousands of people, and thankfully so, for the Yngtaks alone took up two entire floors. I was tired of walking the crowded halls and running afoul of others. For the first time in a long time, I actually wanted to be alone. In that room, only I and my thoughts had motion. But this room had a mirror. As I sat and stared at myself in the lower corner of that reflective surface, I couldn't help but see the battered and scarred body I'd earned for myself by surviving this far. My temple had been drilled into; my cheek had been shot through; my arm had been broken twice; my face had been beaten and kicked to a pulp not too long ago; more and deeper pains the longer I looked. I could die, and so could the ones I loved. This was mortality. But this room had a mirror. Throughout Conrad's entire facility, deeper and deeper into the Earth, every single mirror had been removed. I was the only one that had noticed, and even then I had not really picked up on itand not until that moment. I couldn't put it into words, but, in that quiet realization, I saw the path to defeating my horrible mentor. It would take time and careful strategy, but I suddenly saw him for what he really was, and that gave me the edge. The alarm jarred me from sleep the following morning. The offensive was in motion, and the Coalition Alliance would be moving to assault Her Glory's stronghold in less than three hours. Focus on preparations took over, and I had no time for anything but a warm touch for each of the three people I loved before we donned our helmets, climbed on our new bikes, and rode out alongside tanks and supply trucks, beneath jets and helicopters, and ahead of legions of Yngtak foot soldiers that had been re-armed with the energy lances the spheres had previously taken from them. Our thousand men would not turn the tide alone, but we were armed to the teeth with freshly fabricated vehicles, guns, ammunition, and morale. Her Glory's homeworld held a nightmare landscape. Spiky growing arcs dotted dark hills under a diseased-orange and bile-yellow sky that gave us only chill winds as greeting. The very earth seemed absent; corrugated metal had grown in its place. A river of mercury ran beside us, and we avoided it with apprehension. This was a world overrun with industrial machination, and I found myself rethinking the possibility that the ancient Empress could be a person of good heart. Our way was paved with the destruction of cybernetically-enhanced animals of the kind that had exploded and killed Porcia, and mortars from nearby Vanguard positions created a constant rain of flaring light. We approached what could only be her citadel: a massive mountain encased in a globular shimmering shield whose glimmer I recognized from the skies of my youth. We presented ourselves as reinforcements at an enormous base in a highly defensible chrome valley; called Northern Point for its proximity to the enemy fortress, it would be the launching point for the nuclear-equipped jets, many of which had already taken off. More Yngtaks joined our own here, and I rode open-mouthed alongside my small family of Amber soldiers as I took in the might of the Coalition Alliance. Inverted amethyst pyramids floated overhead, while giants crafted from plant matter lumbered along the earth-bound paths. In the base with us, Noah gawked at a pale-skinned and white-haired woman in jade armor and told me, ""That's gotta be the dead woman that helped Alek Staley's people on the first Exodus!"" I was glad for my helmet, for it hid my awkward stare. She was walking around! She was expressionless and white as bone, sure, but she hardly seemed dead. If she was, it was not fair in the least. Why was it that Death had so many exceptions for everyone but me and the ones I loved? Putting that thought aside, I told Noah on a private channel, ""Alright. We're here. There's not much time. Let's find the Amber chain of command."" He replied an affirmative on the same channel. He knew that only myself, my three, and Cristina were aware of our real mission; Caecilia, Trajan, Paulinus, Larentia, and Septus would have to remain in the dark for the moment. I ached to tell Caecilia, for I trusted her capability in all things, but I had not had the opportunity to catch her alone and there was no easy way to speak privately to her now without raising suspicion. We stood next to our bikes and watched the frantic preparations until an unassuming young man in non-descript clothes passedand Noah gave a subtle nod in his direction. Cristina followed Noah and me closely while Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia maintained an inconspicuous rear guard. We tracked the young man to a tent in a rear corner of the base that was nearly out of sight behind stacks of equipment crates. Within, we could see the movement of a dozen men, and Noah indicated that all of them were from the Amber Worlds. I wasn't sure what the plan was, and I turned to consult only to find Cristina pushing right into the tent. We stepped in after her to back her up; fourteen soldiers stared at us. They had each been doing something with gear and weapons, but had stopped upon our intrusion. Hot winds surged behind us as the first nuclear strikes detonated in the unseen distance outside the tent; a great rumble shook the flat corrugated metal under our boots. The attack had begun, but it was not too late to call off the offensive. Without missing a beat, Cristina took control with the manner of a seasoned officer, but she said no such thing. Holding out her tablet device, she ordered, ""Give me the complete Vanguard roster. The full million. I want their finders after this is over."" ---

s_552_263,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"I'll never forget the first time she punched me in the face. I just stood there in shock. Physically, she's one of the strongest women I've ever met. Especially when she's in a rage. When I moved all of our stuff out of our house there wasn't a door frame or drawer or cabinet unbroken from her rage over the most selfish of insignificant injustices(she felt) were being perpetrated on her. It's taken me 8 months to try to understand the disorder(s) and her childhood trauma and WHY she is the way she CHOOSES TO BE. Make no mistake...they have the ability to restrain themselves. They don't respect anyone enough to do it because they feel everyone is either doing them wrong, will do them wrong, or the scariest thing of all...will make them vulnerable by loving them like I did. Their fear of abandonment runs unusually deep, yet it's EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO TO THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEM. I can't paint a picture of how much I cherished her. I tried my best to make sure she never had a necessity ever run dry. One way or another, no matter the risk or sacrifice, I NEVER let her go without. My mother was agitated with the way I ""babied"" her. To me it was just how I felt about her. I cherished her. Just like any narcissistic/codependent relationship though, the bar would be raised so she could justify the devaluing as her BPD and Bipolar would have her splitting and idealizing the ""doormat parachute"". Her learning disabled, mentally challenged ex husband who's barely literate and hasn't matured intellectually beyond high school. He'll allow her to run back, use him for resources, cheat on him and break his heart, all while the kids watch. It's a repeat record left on play that she somehow thinks will play a different song with each restart of the needle. They aren't just mentally ill. They're spiritually ill. I actually died on my second suicide attempt after I was hospitalized for stress induced cardiomyopathy(second one...the first was after her previous discard which she swore on the lives of her children she'd never do again) and had an extremely profound NDE. I was given the chance to stay in the most indescribable and infinite loving light you could ever imagine, OR...From what I was shown and have literally seen playing out like clips of a movie film...come back to try and redirect her from destroying everyone that loves her, and in tbe end, herself. I made a MASSIVE mistake. After her psychotic break in January where I feel was really a spiritual battle she lost to something very dark, who came out is void of any of the good she had in her. 7 years...engaged to be married last Spring...and she just ghosted me with no explanation. No closure. I'm a living corpse of constant suicidal ideation and excruciating heartbreak. I've tried every type of therapy, multiple mood stabilizers and other prescriptions...even street drugs to attempt to numb me and it's all in vain. What she did to me...The man that ""Loves her like a fairytale"" as she used to say...is the cruelest thing I've ever seen a person do to someone that loves them. For her to walk away from it without a scratch is a massive slap in the face, and I have no fear of death. The closest connection to the creator and the teacher Jesus Christ I was made unwaveringly aware and faithful in that perhaps the only thing that might snap her out of it is the public knowledge that she killed me. The guy every girl saw with her and slapped their SO telling them to be more like...I've literally not stopped crying for 8 months. I'm NOT going g back to inpatient to have my grief treated as the emotions of a child and be talked to like a developmentally disabled child. Honestly...I'm already dead anyways. I keep this typed up to show people how a narcissist or any other Cluster B can destroy you if you fall in love with one: After almost 7 years of believing I was just too defective to love the soul mate"" or ""Twin Flame"" God gave me and that's why she discarded me every 2 years, I found out what it""(Narcissistic Abuse) wastoo late. Since my 3rd discard in the relationship(you can call it splitting if you prefer, it doesn't change the pain it causes though) by the person I'd do anything for and love more than life itself in February after she had a psychotic break and obviously lost part of her soul, I am now in psychotherapy 2 to 3 days a week. I'm recovering from my SECOND stress induced cardiomyopathy in the relationship with the person I love most in this world from the heartbreak. It's a type of heart attack brought in by sudden severe emotional trauma. My heart is probably malformed for life. I'm still at risk for cardiac arrest. I have NAS(NarcissisticAbuseSyndrome), severe depression with CONSTANT suicidal ideation...I've attempted suicide 4 times, actually being successful on the second but lived ultimately, and that's where I had a near/post death experience that will shape the rest of my life, for however long that may be. I'm now diagnosed with CPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder as well. I lost 44 lbs in 4 months. People with BPD are VERY COMMONLY misdiagnosed and treated(with catastrophic consequences) as ""Bipolar"". HIGHLY narcissistic traits and the pattern of narcissistic abuse in their Unstable relationships is also not uncommon. You might be dealing with ANY...OR MORE THAN ONE...Cluster B Personality Disorders in these people who inflict this kind of abuse on the people who love them most. Her response to learning of my second suicide attempt was that she's the happiest she's been in YEARS. Whether it's the depression and heartbreak that kills me or the actual damage to my PHYSICAL HEART makes little difference to me. The fact remains that the person I have loved and adored more than anyone in my lifetime has ZERO empathy, compassion, or remorse after nearly 7 years together. I was thrown away in the blink of an eye like an old gum wrapper on the floorboard of a used car, with no explanation at all...let alone closure. I'm a pretty tough guy. Played hockey for 9 years. I've taken a 7.62X39 through the shin and out my calf and kept moving. I've broken a femur, had my lower row of teeth knocked out in a hockey game and kept playing the game b4 going to the hospital...had my sciatic nerve nearly severed...and never shed a tear. I have cried from the moment I opened up my eyes in the morning until I go to sleep for 7 months. Nothing is helping. I honestly cant live like this.. Whether it's ""BPD SPLITTING"" or ""NARCISSISTIC DISCARDING"" doesn't change the impact it has on a person who did nothing more than commit the awful crime of loving them. I'm LITERALLY just another a living corpse under her feet. All for the crime of Loving her like a fairytale. Her words, not mine.","I have NAS(NarcissisticAbuseSyndrome), severe depression with CONSTANT suicidal ideation...I've attempted suicide 4 times, actually being successful on the second but lived ultimately, and that's where I had a near/post death experience that will shape the rest of my life, for however long that may be.",4651,8,1

I seem to remember^[citation ^needed] that appetite suppression has been linked to the patient's genetics, so YMMV. This stuff is used to treat eating disorders, though, so that gives you an idea of how powerful it is in this respect. The effect only lasts so long as you are actually on the meds, so breakfast (and probably dinner) shouldn't be affected at all. Methylphenidate already has a rough comedown, though, and low blood sugar makes it much worse, so it's not a good idea to let yourself have two meals. Speaking personally: sometimes it's a simple matter of the MPD turning my focus into a freight train that barrels right past the feeding cue station and does not want to stop. It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing. SOMETIMES though it causes revulsion to the thought of food. I liken it to that feeling you get when you've eaten too much and someone offers you more food. My body finds it hard to *believe* that it could need sustenance, and my brain doesn't appreciate being taken off hyperfocus mode to do something it doesn't think it needs to do. Pushing past this can be tricky but there are always things I can find that my body will be OK with. I'm not a picky eater, but MPD makes me one. Little snacks help but it's better to bite the bullet and eat a full meal on schedule. I also have unrelated colitis, so this may be a factor in my case. Honestly, the comedown from MPD is the biggest problem for me. I turn into a big bearded diva if I'm not careful, so I NEED to remember to have lunch. This will seem unmanageable at first but go easy on yourself in the late afternoon (taking a 5 mg ritalin at around 2:30 also helps soften the down curve for some), and it will subside after awhile
Was the doctor putting you on *both* atomoxetine and MPD though? As I said Strattera would be the bigger concern for me with the things you listed. PS: Yeah, people can negative about this med. I keep coming back to it though, and recently went back on after 2-3 years without anything. People have cause to be negative about all of the meds, though. Nothing is going to be 100% take-the-good-leave-the-bad. It's a matter of finding what works best for you. Adderall, for instance, is not something I want to touch ever again. Other people on this sub will tell you the opposite, but that's just what works for our individual brains.","It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing.",763,2,1

The doctor diagnosed me with chronic depression (I've had depression since I was 11/12 years old... I'm 26 now) and anxiety. He felt Lexapro would be a good start for me to be on it. With the medication, it does help but lately for some reason, I'm always up this late and I would go to bed at 2am. Then again, it may not be related to the medication. I feel my body running on fumes. I'm exhausted. Though I feel the need to be on computer often now because I find myself becoming more entertained on it. I feel the need to research and find new ideas in life. Am I trying too hard to pursue, trying to get my life back in order? To make up for lost times?? I don't know, I don't get myself. I still find myself, staying inside at my home and I would be on computer most of the time. I think it's fear of change. There are times when I would think that change is good. It's nice doing something different. But there are times when I would lose interest, no motivation to do something different, to do something productive and I would try, at all cost, to avoid change because I am feeling comfortable with the way I am and how I am. I am still adjusting to the medication so the question would be when would it start working for me? I know the doctor said it may take 4 to 6 weeks to take in full effect of the medication. Maybe I'm impatient, I don't know. I just want to live my life.","With the medication, it does help but lately for some reason, I'm always up this late and I would go to bed at 2am.",298,3,1
s_2890_292,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"You Don't Do That To Family Grandma started to lose her mind as she aged, and Mother thought it would be wise to take her into our home. She thought it might slow the progression, or at least keep her comfortable until her mind was emptied of every last one of it's marbles. Grandma was always a strict, bitter, and admittedly terrifying woman. She was well respected, but also feared. No one dared stand up to her, even as she started insisting that her delusions and hallucinations were true. We went along with it, but we also anxiously awaited the day that the 90 year old would pass. Myself being nearly twenty five meant that I did the majority of the housework to pay my dues, and Grandma was strict about it. Dad's been gone my entire life, I had no other siblings, and an ectopic pregnancy ruined my chances at having my own family and tore apart my fragile relationship. These two women are all I've got, and I needed them when I was alone and my mind slunk into dark places. Living with my mother wasn't the most desirable thing, but since my loss I haven't been able to function at 100%. Mom could use the help anyways, living alone can be depressing. I had been back home for a month when Grandma had come to stay with us. She wasn't quite as crazy when she first got there, just constantly mumbling about voices. I wasn't ecstatic about housing and caring for a mad woman, but I figured it could be worse. I thought it would be something else to take my mind off of constant dark thoughts, but she ended up being a black hole. After a few weeks of staying with us her condition was becoming noticeably worse. Her mumbling turned to shouting, and she began insisting the things she saw and heard were real. We had to play along or risk facing a violent outburst. She'd throw anything close enough to grab, and it fucking hurt if you were in the way of whatever she was throwing. We were nearly two months into this hell when she got my mother across the chest with a plate. It cut her deeply, and she had to go to the hospital for stitches. Grandma had always been a bitter woman, but this illness was bringing it to new levels. Mom refused to tell anyone outside the family how she really got the injury, and you could tell the secret was eating her up inside. She followed the one most important rule: You don't do that to family. Which meant, you *never* admit to someone outside the family that someone inside did something wrong. It was a rule that had been heavily enforced for generations. After that incident the situation in the house got very tense, and it made me wish I could get my shit together enough to leave. I'd feel awful leaving my mother alone with Grandma though. Another month and things were intolerable. The house was a constant cascade of noises, TVs, radios, and loud uncomfortable voices filled any silence. Silence was no longer allowed. Partaking in the delusions meant more than just patting the old woman on the shoulder and saying, Yes, I hear it too. We had to help her block out the voices, or face her wrath. I honestly couldn't understand why my mother wouldn't just put her in a home. I'd asked her, and every time she gave the same reply, You don't do that to family. I can understand the sentiment, I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if I had a child who sent me away to die in a false paradise. Old age homes are depressing, I've never met someone with any happy stories about sending a family member to one. Now, Grandma would be a different case. She didn't really deserve the amount of kindness we afforded her, but it wasn't entirely her fault. Sure she was a bitch before she went crazy, but it wasn't nearly as bad. The constant noise was enough to drive you up the wall, and I ended up finally using my prescription for sleeping pills. Along with the antidepressants I'd already been taking they helped enough to bring living there to a level only slightly below intolerable. It was okay, at least I could sleep through the noise. Mom didn't get the luxury of taking pills to shut it out, though she tried. The sleeping pills didn't work well enough for her, and the blaring radio coming from Grandma's room kept her up nearly every night. I think her true breaking point was about a month and a half ago. We were sitting down for dinner together, both the tv and radio were screaming the news from the living room. I could tell she was agitated, but I didn't realize how much until she got up and unplugged everything. The house fell into a moment of silence before Grandma started screaming. Laura, Laura! Why are you letting them take me! * She shrieked, grasping her head in both hands. After another quiet moment she looked to me instead, Mary, sweet child, don't let her do this to me. God, make it stop! * MAKE IT STOP!* I recoiled as her voice raised, unsure of what to do. Grandma it's okay, please--
Shut the *fuck* up. Is it so hard to just have a minute of quiet? My mother cut me off with a glare. I was shocked, to say the least. I didn't understand why she was suddenly and so aggressively deciding to stop playing into Grandma's delusions. I didn't have time to ask her either, because that was the moment when a butter knife flew across the table. The heavy metal handle her hit her just above her temple, and the blood was immediate. She was pissed, but in a terrifyingly calm way. She touched her fingers to the wound, looked at the blood, and smiled. You fucking *bitch,* She said in a low voice, I care for you, take you into my home, put up with your bullshit, and when we don't play along for thirty seconds you hurt us? Grandma looked a little shocked but resumed her yelling, They're going to take me, they took my baby! Look how she disobeys me, she's handing me to the voices! Mother shook her head and walked away from the table, and I did the only thing I thought would help. I started a random conversation with Grandma, something to distract her from her screaming and give my mom a chance to calm down and relax. It wasn't very helpful, I wasn't loud enough to block out the false voices in Grandma's head. I ended up sitting her in front of the TV and putting the news back on at a disgustingly loud volume. I went to find my mom and ask her if she was okay. She was in the bathroom tending to her wound. Are you going to the hospital? Did you really turn that damn TV back on? She replied without looking at me. Um.. Yea. I figured it was better than the screaming..
I'm not going anywhere, someone will wonder why I've needed stitches twice in as many months. We don't talk about this kind of thing with other people. You don't do that to family. Oh, and stop making noise. I have a migraine and I'm going to lose it on someone if I hear another sound for the rest of the day. She pushed past me and walked away, leaving me conflicted. I spent the rest of the day trying to deal with the screaming, and when I could no longer take it I decided I needed to calm Grandma down. Mom had gotten so pissed off that she had moved the TV and radio from the living room into her own bedroom and closed herself in with them. There was only screaming to be heard in the house. I spent hours trying to talk Grandma out of it, but it only calmed her slightly. When mom finally came out of the room she looked exhausted. Didn't I tell you to shut up? She sighed. I felt bad for disobeying, but I didn't know how else to deal with it. You want tea Mary? Im gonna make us all some tea so we can forget about this stressful day. I nodded, wanting to avoid her freaking out again. We all sat and drank the tea, while Mom sang loudly to avoid the screaming. It was almost a peaceful moment. I checked the time after we finished and it was getting late, so I helped Grandma up the stairs and into bed. I turned on her bedside radio, and she was asleep within a few minutes. Relative peace at last. The day had exhausted me. I called a goodnight down the stairs to mom, and went into my own room. I couldn't immediately find my sleeping pills, but I was so exhausted that I didn't bother searching. I'd sleep fine without taking one. I slept better than I had in months, it was deep and peaceful and when I finally woke up I wished I could have stayed asleep forever. It was still dark, I was groggy and in a great amount of pain. I brought my hand to my face and I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I ran to the bathroom and caught sight of myself in the mirror, and my mouth bled as it attempted to open and vomit. I choked it down and cried silent tears. My mouth was sewn shut. Somehow through my shock I noticed an empty pill bottle in the sink, my sleeping pills. I had refilled the prescription only two days ago, meaning that nearly thirty pills had been used. I felt sick as I realized what my mother had done. I ran to Grandma's room next, and found her in the same mutilated state as I was. Only, she was also cold to the touch. I fought the urge to vomit again, and left the room. She either overdosed or asphyxiated and I wasn't trained to tell which was the case with her mouth sewn. I couldn't find my mother anywhere in the house, and when I pulled out my phone I realized that she could be anywhere right now. I had slept for nearly two days. No wonder I didn't wake up while being mutilated, I was nearly comatose. I wanted to call the police, but as I was about to dial I kicked myself internally. * You can't talk, stupid.* I walked my sorry ass to the nearest hospital, not wanting to traumatize anyone on the way. My car was missing, so I guess that's what mom used. The hospital staff nearly shit themselves when I walked into the emergency room, it was *almost* funny. This entire part if my journey is fairly boring, except for when they realized that behind my sewn lips I had no tongue. They replaced it, but I haven't learned how to speak again yet. I'm scared to talk ever again. The police came to question me about what happened, but I only wrote down that I couldn't remember. Obviously my mother was a suspect, they had found Grandma's body in her house. I know it seems messed up that I wouldn't directly admit what my mother did, but I have three very good reasons for that. She was already the only suspect. I was afraid she'd find me and punish me again for speaking when I shouldn't. You don't do that to family. [HF](<URL>)",I choked it down and cried silent tears.,8503,0,1

It took three months to get them to trust me. Three months spent in virtual isolation; three months spent eating one step better than garbage just to survive. I figured makeshift prisons run by Chinese rebels would hardly be luxurious, but those three months will haunt my sleep if I survive this. Until the day this struggle ends, there are far worse nightmares to faceand while awake. That Starbucks, that day, those seven Venti coffees; I broke something in myself three months ago while sitting at that table guzzling stimulant. Out the window and across the street I could see ramshackle ghettos, while on my side of the divide everything was clean, bright, and happy. Each coffee subtly changed that dynamic. I would say that the ideal level of caffeination for busy-bee workers is somewhere between half a Venti black coffee at minimum and two full ones at maximum. While in that range, every sip I took gradually shrank my awareness in a way only an experienced caffeine addict could notice. Creativity and thinking outside the box became slightly harder while focusing on specific mundane tasks became slightly easier. In that regard, I almost became more concerned with writing down my changing symptoms than with actually drinking the coffee. It took an act of will to force myself to proceed. I'd kicked caffeine for the first time in years, but now I'd given myself back to it, and my brain was very happy with the flood of energy. It wanted to enjoy the high; it did not want to keep drinking with the specific intent to make myself sick. Nevertheless, I began gulping more even as my pulse rose and my fingers began subtly shaking. The third full coffee brought the change in the world's tone to a noticeable level. The bright colors had faded in favor of greys and browns, and the street outside was dingy and cracked in small ways I had not noticed before. The ghetto across from me remained horrible; I watched a haggard mother hang laundry on a high rope strung between two rotting wooden spires. Each breath brought that surge of fire I recognized as the limit of caffeination, and I had to carefully regulate myself to keep my heart rate down. For now, I was still fine, but I was only at three of seven coffees. Taking a deep breath, I chugged the fourth. The tilt in my perceptions nearly made me slide from my seat. The world had not shifted physically, but my sense of myself within it certainly had. Looking around, I sighted for the first time bits of garbage, rust, and decay on my side of the divide. People walking on the streets didn't seem to notice; one stepped in what looked like dog excrement but continued walking without bothering to scrape it off. I watched three workers inside the Starbucks itself ignore a small pile of trash that customers kept stepping on. But still I was submerged in a long, deep, and slow river of complacency. My body was agitated, but my mind was full of excuses not to notice, mention, or otherwise regard these strange discrepancies. Downing the fifth coffee rapidly as a way of surprising myself and breaking through that submersion, I clutched the edges of control to stay centered. Each gasp brought oxygen, while each exhalation brought fuzziness at the edges of my vision. I began to feel claustrophobic and unsafe. Rusted corners and smelly bits of garbage made themselves prominent in my awareness; I slung my bag and grabbed my two remaining coffees and stumbled out onto the street. The sub-provincial city of Guangzhou no longer looked to me as all the others that I had visited. I could see character now, mostly in aged buildings off the main path, and the bright colors and cleanliness had been stripped away. This place was run down and industrial, and I had not seen it as such until my fifth coffee. The sixth filled me with very unpleasant internal heat. I'd come here ostensibly to investigate a claim that had caught my eye; I was within a block of that location, and wandered along my side of the street opposite the ghetto to investigate the site of the supposed accident. It was a simple alleyway, much like the one in Jerusalem, but this one held stacks of garbage and low pools of unidentifiable filth. I braved the muck to search the walls, and, this time, I was ready when I found the unknown invisible vines. Here goes nothing, indeed. I kept my eyes on the wall and downed my seventh and final coffee. The pain in my head became two directed blades moving through my forehead and temples. I winced, but kept my gaze forward. I needed to see this. If seven coffees didn't blow open the flaw in the lie, nothing would. Someone had pulled the wool over my eyes, and forcing it out of my system was the only way. Shivering horribly and fighting a body-wide surge of dangerous over-stimulation, I watched with triumph as patchwork lines began to weave themselves into existence before me. It was the same material that the doctor in Zimbabwe had found in Kudakwashe's throat. I knew it immediately. It ran along the walls like vines of ivy, but, as the doctor had said, it looked to be some sort of neural tissue. Somehow, it had the ability to hide itself from perception. This was what I'd stabbed into on that Zimbabwean rooftop, and this was what had made everyone around it scream and run at me to defend it. How had it done that? Did it generate some kind of neural field to blanket our senses? What *was* this stuff? Clenching my fists to keep a hold of myself against the tide of caffeine, I followed the neural vines higher and higher with my sight. They'd grown over this building, in the alley in Jerusalem, and high up in Zimbabwe. Where else might these spots of infection be growing? I stepped out of the fetid alley to follow its run further, but froze in horrified awe as I got my first unedited visual of the sub-city. There were two perceptions there; one, the faux clean clone, the other a monstrously overgrown hive. My vision flickered as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing: *a veritable jungle of hanging neural vines, conduits, and pillars had grown across the entire city.* Thick masses hung between high buildings; curving nerves spread out fractally along nearby streets. The shock and the caffeine combined were too much. I fell to my knees at the whim of a body-wide seizing vomit. Worse, the pain in my temples had become what felt like motion, and a writhing therein made me scream and grip myself to fight for sanity. Static blurred my sight, random voices shouted in my hearing, and two long worms of strange tissue burrowed out the sides of my eyes, fell to the dirty street, and shriveled up. Drops of blood fell straight down from my vision as I stared at what had just crawled out of my temples and died on the ground before me. The caffeine wracked me with pain, but I knew now that I'd done it: I'd poisoned myself hard enough that my perceptions had finally become clear. What the hell were they? Entities in their own right? Or just some form of connection to the previously invisible neural jungles growing all over the world? Had the human race evolved some sort of literal group hive mind, or were we under attack by something else? The madman. He'd written of this. He'd been intent on cutting the neural fibers out of my eyes directly. That's what he'd done to himself, and that was how he'd gained the ability to truly *see.* I'd chosen another route, but it had not been without its risks. I threw up twice more before losing consciousness on the sidewalk. Four hundred and fifteen milligrams of caffeine in a Venti black coffee, and I'd had seven. Five grams was a potentially lethal dose, and I'd had at least sixty percent of that. I descended into darkness with nothing but a small hope that my years as a coffee addict would see me through this. The first question I became aware of was simple. "" How did you do that?"" Several periods of blurred consciousness brought me to waking in a sealed underground parking lot that looked like it had never been finished. The man who had spoken was not present, but he soon visited with food and water. He asked again in perfect English, ""How did you do that?"" I shook with the after-effects of caffeine near-overdose, but managed to respond, ""Do what?"" He kicked me in the ribsnot too hard, just enough to show that he was seriousand I said, ""I'll tell you, just please clarify!"" He moved his wrinkled but hardened face closer and tapped my temple. "" Removed your blinders."" I winced at his touch before realizing the implications of his question. "" Wait, you're aware of them? Do you also see the world as it truly is?"" He gave me another sharp kick. "" I've tortured better men than you until they wished for death. Understand your position. I ask, you tell."" I nodded in acceptance. "" I, uh, took sixty percent of a lethal dose of caffeine."" His glare was sharp. "" How did you calculate a lethal dose? The same amount for others may kill them."" ""It was just a guess based on articles I've read,"" I protested, staving off another kick. "" I've been addicted to caffeine for years, so I may have withstood it better."" He pulled back. "" So her story was true. She watched you from our side of the border, and she said you drank coffee until you became violently ill."" I held up my hands to ward off the bright light that his change in position had cast upon me. "" Now a silhouette, he asked, ""And what did you see?"" ""Look,"" I told him, trying to think quickly. "" I don't think you and I are enemies. I've been pursued by crazy people, got my finger cut off, my ear sliced, some guy wanted to cut my eyesI have *no idea* what's going on, but I do think the human race is in serious trouble. There areGod, there's like some sort of infestation out thereit's everywhere! I think we're under attack!"" He gave a dark laugh and moved away, saying, ""You just saved your life, and you don't even know why."" A door slammed somewhere distant, and I was left alone in a poorly lit crumbled stone prison. I walked the length of my confinement for a few hours, finding a scattering of shitty fluorescent lights illuminating empty parking spots and incomplete stairwells. Some of these stairwells led up toward daylight very *very* high up, but nothing but sheer concrete and the occasional rotting foothold presented itself. They had no guards on this exit for a reason: the climb was suicide. An entire month passed before I received my next visitor. I was self-aware of the effects that solitary confinement was having on me, but this was no hallucination. The same man opened a door, but only his guest came inside; that creature that had once crawled out of my severed pinky finger now skittered into the room on bone-white blade-like legs. Ivory eyes watched me unblinking, and I heard its voice in my head again: *Are you done playing the fool?* There was no escape this time, but I still moved back a few steps. "" After a thought, I added, ""I understand what you meant now by my senses betraying me. I've seen it."" The question now is whether you are a double agent. It is exceedingly rare that a human being breaks free from the Entity on its own. Would you have us believe you are just that smart?* I looked past the Bonewalker toward the door where my human former interrogator stood. He seemed very uncomfortable with the creature's presence, and nodded for me to speak carefully. I finally said, ""A little smart, but mostly just way too addicted to caffeine."" It seemed to accept that answer. * You spoke of a man that tried to cut your eyes.* *Describe him.* I gave it the best description I could of the man with the wild glee and surgical knife, but I couldn't tell what it thought of my words. It left immediately, this time jumping into a small open wound on the man at the door's arm; he shivered, pulled a bandage over it, and closed the door. Was he a guard? Or someone higher level? If the crazy doctor was someone this group wanted, then I might have been regarded as a very important prisoner. Indeed, the quality of my given food rose, and guards came in to play cards with me and keep me company. I understood that this was both luxury for my information and a test of my true character; I made sure to be completely honest about every single thing they asked me. I had nothing to hide. I even told them about the breakup, and my hollow reactions to it. At the end of the second month, the Bonewalker returned. This time, I was in the open-topped stairwell standing in the rain, but it didn't seem to care about the falling liquid. * The guards seem to think you're not a liar.* I'd had plenty of time to craft my strategy. "" Tell me one thing. I assume the Entity is something related to the neural fibers growing all over the world. Are you opposed to it?"" The creature's ivory eyes gave no hint of connotation or elaboration. * ""Then that means we're on the same side,"" I told it, taking a risk. "" Regardless of whatever organization or power structure you've got control of."" *You would choose the more personable of two dooms?* it asked. * You will remain untreated, for it can sense the blood-bond. None of my humans can ever truly be a part of its society.* There was a chance I would come off as a double agent fishing for information, but I also genuinely wanted to know. "" How much do you control?"" *Thirty percent.* So the ghettos had been made terrifying in our perceptions on purpose to separate us from the opposition. "" Thirty percent of China, that's a sizable""
*Of the Earth,* it responded. A clicking followed, a sound I took to be laughter. * You're not a double agent. You're too full of yourself, like most humans. Know that you will be watched, and if you betray us, you will die in the manner you are most afraid of.* Could it see that? Could it see my fears? I gulped as it crawled away without another word. And what of being watched? Did it mean I was to be released? The third month was full of tension and confusion. Gone were the guards and the visits. Had I done something wrong? Finally, the man who had first interrogated me dragged me out the door and up a long set of stairs to release me into a moderately disheveled area that I might once have seen as ruined and horrible. After undoing a temporary pair of handcuffs, he told me, ""That doctor has a special interest in you. Let him find you, then bring him to us. He is very important to this fight."" I nodded, and accepted money and a folded set of clothes from him. ""And take a shower,"" he said as a final note of goodbye. "" I did reekbut there was wind to carry the smell away and a sun in the sky. I was free. Wandering the streets and watching the poor go about their lives the best they could with what they had on hand, I realized that life was precious. I'd been doing nothing with it since I'd been hollowed out by someone I'd loved, and yet here there were people that did not have the suits or the offices or the coffeepeople making do, raising kids, and having afternoon chats from window to window. This was the Bonewalker's territory, and it was not altogether bad. The divide between territories was stark. Neural masses hung from building to building directly across the final street, and I could see raised lines of parasitic flesh along the temples of passersby. My God, it hadn't been a caffeine nightmare! Seventy percent of the Earth had been overtaken by an infection of unknown proportions, and the other thirty percent held fast only under the vicious rule of the Bonewalker. Where was the human spirit in all this? Where was *our* faction? Eyes were upon me even thenfrom both sidesso I resolved to keep my counsel to myself. If there was to be one at all, I had to be the start of our faction. I'd figured this out myself, freed my own perceptions through risk and calculated daring, and I'd dodged the Bonewalker's control as well. I knew who my first true ally would be, too: the very man that creature wanted. Who are you, Doctor? What do you have that both these nightmares want? I've left enough keywords in this for you to find it, and I know you're obsessive enough to contact me despite the risk. I'm back in the States, and I have a suspicion you know where to find me. ---

I have had GAD for the last 25 years, since I was a child. Recently it has developed into/incorporated panic disorder too. Nine weeks ago, my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He passed away one week ago. Since we heard the diagnoses, I have been suffering from recurring panic attacks, been struggling day to day and especially at night with anxiety, and lack of sleep is making it very hard to focus on my usual rescue 'remedies'. My Dr prescribed lorazepam, and upped my citalopram dose six weeks ago. He doesn't want me on the lorazepam for long, but, although the panic attacks have decreased in frequency, they are still happening often and the lorazepam us the only thing I have found so far that works quickly and helps. My main trigger at the moment is panicking that my children are going to catch Noro, and then we will all get it. At the moment, one of them even looking a little off color is sending me straight into a panic attack. I struggle with not being in control and this is one area that I do not cope with the uncertainty and unpredictability of everything. I feel that I am alone in all situations, even though I have a great husband who would manage even if I wasn't there. I am flying back to the UK from the US this week for the funeral, and I am going over all the things that could go wrong.

s_782_6,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"On recurring, severe depression and the will to live Live is a journey that always has an end regardless of how we live, and it's one most people enjoy or simply wouldn't like to end. However, what is life without the joy of living? What is living not for you but to avoid hurting your family or because another being depends on you and your love, say a child or a pet? That's a long torture that seems to have no end and it consumes you slowly but steadily if you don't find anything that makes you enjoy being there, and that's the problem; sometimes there isn't anything, not a light awaiting for you, not a thing that gives you a speck of happiness but only momentary joy that fades as soon as it ends. Non-depressed people sometimes say ""happiness is a choice"" and ""it's the little things that together form happiness"", but no. For some of us Happiness is not a choice but an uphill struggle for something seemingly unattainable and those little things mean nothing because they fade away. Therapy and different medications and procedures have helped thousands to overcome and get over their depression, but it's but frustrating when years pass, you try to give your best despite barely having energy for days in a row and despite feeling miserable inside when awake and despite wearing a ""mask"" in front of other people and when you adhere to prescribed drugs that make some things even worse just to try and hit the root cause but nothing improves inside. I could give you my personal elaborate and detailed sob-story, but it doesn't really matter here because one of my root caused for my depression is that I have no desire of living, I don't want to be here and keep feeling pain, both physical and psychological.

s_1831_20,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,"Everything I know is going upside down. I can't take it anymore. I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and ""fun"" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then. Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing ""the right thing"" and that everything was going to be better now. What a fucking liar. After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of ""the best of the best"". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to ""become healthier"" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house. Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were ""incapable and horrible at raising us"". Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night. I can't concentrate, and my addiction to Smash Bros. and it's world has become destructive. I've stopped caring about things, my future, my friends, nothing but trying to escape the real world. Each night, I'm doing plenty of chores, taking care of all three dogs, taking care of dinner occasionally, sometimes trying to do schoolwork and spending the rest of the time on Imgur, Skype and Reddit, browsing for no true reason. My mom is smoking a pack a day, and, when she's not working, is laying in bed feeling sick. My grandma is wheeling around, being demanding and yelling at us about stupid crap that doesn't matter. She attempted to stab my mother with a fork because my grandma took a burger from us and tried to feed it to the dogs, and when my mom tried to stop her, my grandma yelled that ""she's trying to help the only ones that matter to her."" My brother is remaining oblivious to most of it, thankfully, but is glued to his Kindle and spends most of the time avoiding his work, making me do it. Dad's at work and only sees us occasionally, and that's driving him mad, and grandpa's with his significant other, doing what he pleases and being cheap on us. I've contemplated suicide once or twice, but I've never acted on it because I know it will only cause more pain to my family. I'm nearly at the point of giving up. I can't do anything anymore without causing someone trouble. None of my friends really try to help, and my family's attempts to help me have failed. I'm becoming violent, and beginning to obsess over stupid things like those little Nintendo amiibo figures. My life is a mess, and I have no way of escape anymore. Collecting and buying the figures gives me moments of false happiness, as does playing video games. My family is constantly fighting, and I can't do anything to fix it.

My parents weren't abusive, (though my mother could be emotionally I suppose) but they are serious professional types and were very emotionally neglectful. My family moved around a lot and I was left with a series of unstable babysitters, and was bullied severely by other kids. I started dissociating and dealing with that by just distracting myself with hobbies and pop culture. I had really deep knowledge in things like history and literature from a young age because I used those things to occupy myself from strong emotions and dissociation. These interests might have looked like ""autistic interests"", but they weren't, they were some mix of stress and being above average intelligence. I had anger problems and seriously over reacted to things through my preteen/early teen years, which definitly could have been mistaken for the ""meltdowns"" people with aspergers have. I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress. Blank stares and not being able to identify your own emotions are common symptoms for PTSD and Aspergers.

s_2257_110,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,"Multiple issues including OCD,ADHD,Bipolar and BPD? First of all: I am a university student on weekends and I am doing a full time job on weekdays. I am in my mid twenties. I still live with my parents and I don't own any vehicle of my own. The usual length of the university degree I am following is 4 years, and this is my 6th year, because I still have failed subjects and I am trying to retake them and graduate as soon as possible. The job I work on does not suit me, I mean I am bored and I seldom feel interested in the work I do. Why do I still hang around in the job? It pays me (considerably lower than the usual pay but it still pays something) and I want to be independent of my parents. They have paid for my university degree too, and I feel like I should take care of my expenses by myself. I am scared that I'd be a burnout, because I am bored to death of everything in my life. I feel that I have more than one mental health issue: anxiety, depression most likely, and OCD, ADHD(or ADD) and possibly Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Also, I believe I am addicted to porn and social media and junk food. Let me explain the rationale behind my conclusions. Anxiety and depression: Pretty sure, because I often am nervous when carrying out even the simplest tasks and interacting with others (even my family members), and I love my comfort zones like my bed and my room and I feel uneasy whenever I have to leave them. I feel overwhelmed among crowds and I tend to avoid crowded places. It's kinda funny, because I have a thing for singing, and it usually requires performing in front of a crowd. I have done it very few times, and needless to say, I felt very anxious and hard to perform. I cannot handle pressure, especially when there are deadlines. Though I think this is related to ADHD as well. I think I have depression because I am sad most of the time. It's just I don't see many reasons to be happy about in my life right now. I tend to overthink even the smallest and silliest things, and then the end goal is feeling distraught. I spend a lot of time on Social media or daydreaming or sleeping because I feel bored by my university work and office work. I lack enthusiasm to do even the daily tasks like taking a shower or brushing teeth. OCD : I have a habit of repetition of things, washing my hands a lot and checking out if the door is locked immediately after I've locked the door, I feel the need of organizing trivial things. When I see my room unorganized, it really bugs me. So I think this conclusion is pretty justified. I have an acne issue on my skin and I cannot stop myself from picking on scabs and I believe OCD is one of the reasons that I cannot get rid of acne. ADHD or ADD : This one I recently got to know. I have issues in focusing and attention. I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long. if a tas requires a lot of organizing, I spend a lot of time getting ready for that and sometimes try to avoid it altogether. I get easily distracted by surroundings and sometimes my own thoughts. I often doze off in group conversations, this has become a big problem because this happens a lot in office video calls and I don't remember what topics were discussed during the call. I suck at time management and prioritizing my work. I can be forgetful. Bipolar : I have rapid mood swings; one second I'm happy and the next I'm not. I get irritated easily, for simple to no reasons. Sometimes I am really energized up and sometimes I'm lethargic. Sometimes I can talk with someone else for more than one hour and sometimes I don't feel like talking at all. BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) : I feel like either I have more than one personality or I have none whatsoever. I find my interests vary from time to time: for example sometimes I feel like I love football, and sometimes I don't find it very exciting. I have different kinds of thoughts and feelings and they can change rather quickly. So are my interests. I feel like a lot of debate going inside my head on different topics. Maybe this isn't actually BPD. A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed. I still get them from time to time. I sometimes feel like I am not afraid of death anymore (I used to be scared of death all the time), as long as the way of dying is painless and quick, it's just I have stopped worrying about afterlife. Main reason I am still staying here is that I have a responsibility to my family and I have to take care of them, otherwise I would have actually turned this off long ago. I have seen this thing called cycles when expressing depression, which I haven't really experienced. It's like my whole life recently has been one big singular cycle which never ends. Social media addiction : I use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit and I spend a lot of time surfing through them and I cannot control it. Porn addiction : I usually watch porn and masturbate at least once a day and I feel like it's affecting my sleep cycle. My sleep cycle is in disarray. Junk food : Perhaps this is stress eating. I cannot go by myself for a few hours without having a snack or some junk food or a drink (Non alcoholic). I find it incredibly difficult to tackle with 1 of them, because something else from the above list can intervene and make it harder. I once met a psychologist or a psychiatrist and I tried to explain the whole thing to him, but he dismissed my claims and I felt really really hurt after that. I mean I have already paid, why couldn't he listen to me? Because of that, and for obvious anxiety reasons, I find it hard to actually meet a psychiatrist again.

s_2437_0,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Up late Thought I'd post Im 17 years old going into my senior year in high school. The past years of high school have been rough. Freshman year most of my friends went off to hang out with other cliques and shit and started acting like dicks (HIGHSCHOOL WOW). In the winter of my sophomore year I got diagnosed with fucking type 1 diabetes. I'm to embarrassed to tell anyone I'm diabetic which leads to me not taking insulin for days on end. After I got hit with diabetes about two years ago I really stopped giving a fuck. I started smoking weed and drinking shortly after getting it, my grades went to shit too. As soon as I discovered weed I knew I was gonna be hooked. It was the easiest way to get rid of all of my problems temporarily and I loved it, I was smoking 4 times a day by that summer. In my head I knew getting diabetes triggered all this drug use and shit but I really didn't care, I never really valued myself before I got diagnosed but the way I saw it getting diabetes was my excuse to get away with a ton of shit. My parents first caught me with weed a week after I smoked for the first time. They drug tested me and then took my shit, my Dad whooped my ass and then screamed at me to never do it again. I promised him I wouldn't but I was fucking lying right through my teeth. I was so fucking mad the first time I got caught, I felt like I never got my turn to actually experiment with weed before I got caught. Getting caught by my parents triggered a whole downward cycle. They would catch me like once every two weeks after that and I was grounded 24/7. Obviously I wasn't going to stop smoking weed so I could be ungrounded so, I constantly snuck out and ran away to go get drunk or high with my friends. This went on for about 6 months and as time went on my relationship with my parents got worse. To the point where my mom refused to speak to me for a week after I didn't confess to stealing $500 from her wallet (money that was supposed to be spent on my Dad for his birthday. I'm such a piece of shit I know). Last January I ran away one evening and took 25i NBOME (pretty much fake lsd- I thought It was real at the time) and had a horrible trip. During the trip I felt like my life was stuck in the same 1 hour loop for eternity along with some other scary shit. Afterwards though I was fucking losing my mind. My ego was completely shattered and all I wanted to do when I got home was apologies to my parents and cry with my Mom. I though I had given myself brain damage so after coming clean to my parents I vowed to stay sober and rebuild my relationship with my parents (no brain damage though). My Mom put me in therapy that February and I started taking anti anxiety meds soon after. I thought that if I cleaned up my act it would help me understand more about who I am but that didn't work at all and after suffering for two months sober I started doing drugs again last April. It's July now. Im still stealing from my parents to buy weed. I hate myself completely but I don't care about myself enough to fix anything. My parents are really pushing my to go to collage but I'm really not interested at all. I feel as if this is all being forced upon me and I don't get a say. All my parents seem to care about is getting me into a collage so they can go brag to their fucking friends about me. They make me so fucking mad. I'm still in therapy but it really isn't helping. My parents caught me again and I got into a huge fight with my Dad where I ended up running away, stealing a 40 oz from 711 and sleeping on a park bench. My parents I just don't care about anything in anymore. My life is meaningless, all life is in general. It's impossible for anyone to be content ever. I feel that because I'm aware of the sad reality of this world i'll never be able to be happy. I don't want to pick a career, I don't want to go to collage and I really don't want to live anymore. The only thing stopping me from jumping off a bridge one night is my irrational fear that when we die we stay in our bodies unable to move or communicate. Thus leaving me stuck inside a box for all of eternity. That wouldn't explain what would happen to people who are cremated though. I digress

s_1551_0,Find evidence for special case in this post,"Feeling guilty, regretful, and ashamed over what feels like a wasted 5 years I just really need to say something, its eating me up and I have nowhere else to turn. So here it is, 5 years ago soon after I graduated high school I suffered a lower back injury from weight lifting. It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed. I spent months laid up in bed, after finally getting a bone scan after 6 months the doctor told me I was healed and that I needed to do planks to feel better but I didnt care by then. After the next 6 months I tried to distract myself, or find reasons to try to motivate me to rehab that injury but nothing really worked. I tried the planks a little at some point and felt somewhat better, fooled myself into thinking I could handle workout routines I used to do, 0-60 real quick instead of pacing myself and just kept hurting myself every time. Idk why, ego? Damaged pride? Parents never understood every time I tried to say I felt mentally and physically unwell and that I didnt know what to do, and they just kept saying get a job as if that was a cure all. I tried hanging out with friends and drinking, which ended up injuring my knee one night. Eventually friends all went separate ways over the years and Ive felt alone for so long. I was ashamed of not working like everyone else my age but just felt incapable of doing it, I felt more helpless than ever. Parents kept preaching at me about work, I eventually tried a job for a year to just get away from my parents most of the day and to see if that would finally motivate me properly. i was always mentally and physically tired, unmotivated and slowly over time that toxic workplace made me feel like my best was never enough. I quit and told myself I saved up enough money to get me by until I was going to address these injuries and finally move on with my life. During this time the girl I was seeing of 5 months eventually cheated on me. And after 4 months of sulking over her I had sex with a different girl to try and make me forget about her, which led to getting molluscum contagiosum on my genitals but at the time I feared it was something far worse. I was 20 and felt like my life was over before it really got started, I was so scared ashamed and embarrassed. I felt defeated again and again no matter what I did. Gave up, lost hope. But then I mustered up what little courage I had left to go to the doctor, they said they could only do bloodwork and couldnt do physical exams, and that I should go elsewhere to get it looked at. But i wasnt thinking straight, just shaking from the fear and embarrassment. All I could think about was leaving as soon as possible and shutting myself back in my house. I was already there and told her about it, I said just take the blood. I didnt even want to consider more people knowing about it. Results came back a month or so later, everything was negative so it was nothing serious and that relieved me a bit. So I spent weeks on webmd trying to self diagnose myself instead of getting a physical exam like I should have. I just didnt want to be seen at all because I was so ashamed. So I fooled myself into thinking If I wait maybe itll go away in a few months like webmd says and so I waited. A few months pass and its almost my 21st birthday and I was so lonely, no one tried to ever talk to me or see how I was. Felt like my parents gave up on me, almost felt like strangers in the same house, and the rest of my family isnt that close. I stayed inside for almost a year not really doing anything but watching porn, using internet and playing video games. I had no sense of urgency or concept of time, I didnt value or appreciate anything. I didnt care. I couldnt try to reach out to anyone because I felt like there wasnt anyone I could reach to, and Ive never been good about opening up in the first place about personal things. It almost felt like I wasnt real, like nothing was. And everything felt impossible, even the smallest tasks felt like a chore. I hated myself for being so weak and not being strong enough to to the right things. I just couldnt, idk why. I felt like a disappointment and a burden. Sometimes I felt like my suffering wasnt enough to say I was depressed and felt like a loser hiding behind an excuse. I was numb. Time flew by in a blur, after I turned 21 something in me just snapped and I felt, hysterical? I felt like this wasnt right, that it shouldnt be like this. As if something had to be done. A realization that nobody was coming to save me and I had to start thinking and doing for myself. I needed change. I immediately went and got those pesky bumps taken care of, though it took a little longer than it should have. But after that I felt so stupid for being sacred about it all those months prior. I took this realization into 2019, and started trying to finally fix my body. There were set backs, those pains got worse because I sat around for a year doing nothing. And I had stomach pains I never had before that wouldnt go away for over a month, these things discouraged me a bit and that helplessness started to return. My grandmother passed away around this time and it didnt really hurt, so much as it reminded me that life is short and could end at anytime. And that I should try things more and over think less. I went to the doctor again and got checked out, I got a job for a month and got laid off, I tried dating again but ended things early on. These things made me feel alive again, short yet taught me so much compared to previous years. I realized I have so much more of myself to work on and live for. And after delaying it for awhile I set up my wisdom tooth surgery. After the surgery I found that I have courage. And finally around my 22nd birthday I started to workout and rehab my body, and still currently am (unfortunately taking longer than I had hoped). Still feel like I shouldnt work yet until Ive prioritized and ironed out things mentally and physically. Slowly after each little victory my mental health got better. Only in recent months have I started to see and think clearly for the first time in my life, I have genuine confidence. Things that once seemed impossible seem possible. However, like the title says, with this clarity I only am now seeing how I couldve did things differently. How it shouldve been, how if maybe I did 1 or 2 things different maybe things wouldve been better sooner. Maybe Id be further along in life. Im seeing all my old classmates moving on, and here I am stuck in the same place from 5 years ago. Guilt, shame, regret over wasted time. Lost experiences and opportunities in my youth. All I want to do is make up for it, if I can. Im eager and ready, but my body isnt. And the last thing I want is to rush out before it is. And its frustrating. I feel like Im on a time table, and just want to live hard and fast but cant because Im still limited. I wish I wouldve prioritized my body sooner, so I couldve worked more, saved more money and had more options. I dont want to be a failure anymore. I dont know how to quit dwelling on the past, its like Im constantly grieving. Anyways, if you made it all the way through this thank you for taking the time to read my story","It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed.",278,9,1

s_568_565,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake ""Hollywood"" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.","I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably.",1619,0,1

s_2527_4,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"I thought it was just my imagination... Okay...This is an update from [what happened to me one night at my parent's house](<URL>). I was pretty sure it was just my imagination after the sun started to come up and I finally drifted off. When I woke later that morning it all seemed like a dream. One thing that I remember is when I got out of bed I noticed an old photograph of me was on the floor. I was standing in my parent's driveway and I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' shirt. I figured it had just fallen off the shelf and put it back. I talked to my parents and husband about the crazy nightmare I had. They agreed it was unnerving, and we all laughed it off. My husband and I returned home and I started to put that night in the back on my mind. However, since it happened, sleep evades me. I lay awake and stare into the darkness for hours, it's only when I see the grey light of day that I feel my eyelids grow heavy. Last night I was having my usual night of insomnia. It was nearly three in the morning. I was sitting in my studio just browsing the internet. I should mention it was a very clear night. All of a sudden the lights flickered and went out. the only light was coming from my computer monitor. I didn't think much of it, because the power went out only a few days ago, due to a bad storm. I still had a full battery on my computer and I decided to shut it down in case the power was off until morning. I walk out as the computer shuts down to get a glass of water and a book. After my computer completely shuts down it's pitch black in my studio, except for the faint moonlight coming from my huge window. The window is curtained and takes up a five by five foot square in the wall. It faces my massive backyard. [ Just took this picture of it about a minute ago](<URL>). I feel relaxed and look at the clear night sky though my window. It's darker inside the house than outside and it's a beautiful view. As I'm gazing up, I notice a tiny movement out of the corner of my eye to the left of my back yard. I glance over an see a figure of a man walking through the yard. At this point I'm a little shocked because our backyard is completely secluded and fenced off for about .5 acres. I decided I would just watch and see what he did since I was confident that he couldn't see me. He started to make his way across my backyard, moving away from my house. I felt relieved. Then he stopped, facing away from me. He just stood there for a good five minutes, about 50 feet from my window. I didn't move a muscle. I just watched and waited. Then he turned completely around. I swear to god, he looked right at me through my window and I could see the whites of his eyes. Through the pitch darkness, I could see them. He started to move towards me. I was completely petrified but still didn't think that he could see me. I backed up to the wall of my studio. He started to move faster. He was only about 20 feet away from my window when the lights came back on. He could see me! He could see me and I couldn't see him! What the fuck?! I ran out of my studio down the hall into the bedroom and grabbed the gun off the night stand. I shook my husband awake and told him there was someone outside in out back yard. I walked to the back door with him, both of us with our guns drawn. I flipped the back light on and slowly opened the back door. We looked around with the flashlight and we couldn't see anyone. My heart was about ready to come out of my chest. We walked out into the yard, with all the lights turned on and with our guns and flashlights, everything started to seem less sinister. I calmed down and we made our way back to the house. As we were walking back, something caught my eye. I looked over and saw a photograph laying in the grass. As I walked over I noticed it was of me. Bemused and feeling a bit giddy from the adrenaline rush, I picked it up. It was a photograph of me standing in my parents driveway as a kid. I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' tee shirt. I flipped the photograph over. Scrawled in red letters, were the words, ""I can still see you.""",Last night I was having my usual night of insomnia.,928,3,1

s_1542_38,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Hi guys, how much of a problem am I going to have to stop? Hi guys, been doing etizolam once(yes I'm sure, no redosing was occurring) daily for 7 weeks. Usually 2-3mg a day but two days were 10mg and one day I did 20mg, those three days were the only days I dosed more than once. Currently taking 2mg a day for past week, few hours before bed, am using to help sleep, during pandemic finding my depression is worse and is harder to sleep. I sleep like a baby after a few mg of etizolam. I'm assuming I should not stop cold turkey at this point? Would tapering schedule is recommended or cold turkey for this use time? Some people seem to play the long game on the taper and some play the short game. Since I haven't been using long would it be logical to go short here? Like next week go to 1.5mg then next week 1mg then half mg next week then done? Edit: didn't dose last night. Didn't sleep much. Felt like chest was caving in most of the night. No chest pains this morning though. Feel rough and low on sleep and irritated but will probably get through this. I Intend to drink myself to sleep tonight. Cold turkey looks like it was the right call so far, thanks guys! Edit #2 so made it to day 6. No relapse, and also very little sleep. The lack of sleep is starting to get to me. If I do relapse I feel as it will be the lack of sleep that gets me to do it. I don't always make the best decisions when I'm tired. But, so far so good. Edit #3 so last night, night 7 is what I would call my first good night of sleep since quitting. It still wasn't great sleep but was good and the first time I was able to get more than a hour and half of deep sleep in a night since stopping which really helped. Edit #4 hopefully final edit. So I think I'm back to normal, after day 9 I started sleeping normally, good amount of deep sleep and woke feeling good. And after a few days of good sleep I think it's behind me. Respect benzos people, the fact that a short term of use and dosage could effect me for a week was crazy, I've done/abused harder drugs with less of a withdrawal than these things.","Currently taking 2mg a day for past week, few hours before bed, am using to help sleep, during pandemic finding my depression is worse and is harder to sleep.",280,3,1

I moved away from my family in February, and the time I'm spending away will come to an end some time in May 2016. I do not want to move back with my parents at all. My plan was to move to a city about 9 hours away with my dog, and to go to school there (in Canada). I am lucky enough to have parents who are saving up money for my education (unless they're lying to me about that ..), so I will be using this money for school, then try to get a job. The city I'll be moving to is really cheap, and is right by the border, which separates it from a major American city, so there is opportunity from two lands there. I think I've matured enough in the last few years to understand that this isn't going to be easy. And I've accepted potential defeat, though I'm still a stubborn kid at heart, and I refuse to fully accept the outcome of potential failure (like moving back with my family). Doesn't mean I wouldn't. Stories like this scare the shit out of me. I like to believe that I'm ready to live alone, and in a sense, I am! I am partially doing it right now. But money wise, I am terrified. I don't want to have debts, I don't want to be worried about where I spend my money. I know how to budget and I can live cheaply (though sometimes I go overboard), but who says I'll be getting a job? Who says I'll be able to live cheaply at all? For instance, I don't need much space so a studio apartment is perfect for me. I found one for less than 400 dollars a month, which is amazing. Everything included. However, a roof over my head is not the only thing I'll be needing to pay for. Of course, bringing a pet into the mix basically means paying hundreds of dollars for it per year. Will I be able to afford it? Also, food. Food is not so cheap in Canada compared to the US. And, transportation. The city I selected doesn't have a good transportation system, meaning I'll have to figure something out. I'm not a fan, plus it's expensive. Summers are hot in that city, and Canadian winters are not really forgiving to bicycles. And ... who says I'll be getting the hours I need from a job? Who says I'll ever get a job at all ...

Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have nothing going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him.

And every day when the frustration gets to be to much I just scream and question why this had to happen to me. If these injuries never happened Id probably have had a happier and better last 5 years. So much time lost, opportunities lost, potential memories lost. And I know getting in my own head is just wasting more time but being aware of that now doesnt motivate me at all, it only makes it worse.","But now I feel like Im hitting a wall, it becomes so frustrating I feel like I get burnt out, and then end up feeling like I need to force myself into doing something however I just end up thinking about it all day and maybe do it last minute if that, and if I dont do it i really beat myself up over it the next day and it becomes harder.",361,1,1

We've always been friends. Even when he moved across the country two years ago to be with his girlfriend, we still caught up and saw each other when we could. That girlfriend broke up with him, so he called me tonight to vent and just bounce ideas.

Ever since then i have been on and off of medications and treatment. I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist and getting treatment. But he is still treating me with depression and anxiety disorder. Its been about 8 months since I'm on many prescriptions. But i don't think its helping me. I'm still depressed. I constantly get suicidal ideation. My Mental state isnt improving. I feel like its getting worse. I did some research on my symptoms. I know self diagnosis or even looking these up arent good for my treatment, or so i have been told. But the first time i was diagnosed i insisted my parents to take me to a psychiatrist as my health was getting worse(physical and mental). Also Mental health is a taboo in my country. And my parents don't even believe in this. My sibling also has clinical depression and anxiety and he also got treatment (after me. He is older). So, i think i have more than just depression and anxiety. Maybe adhd or bpd. I often think i have autism. I dont feel whole. I always feel like there is a void in my life that i can't fill. I'm at the peak of my worst mental health. I feel numb. Ever since i was diagnosed, all these years seem like a complete blur to me. I cant concentrate in any think for more than a minute.

It was the worst experience of my life and wouldn't wish it upon anyone. I had a collapsed lung and combined with my already severe asthma made me want to die. During this time I also fell into a deep depression and my anxiety soared.

Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise. Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope. Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working. For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety. Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies. I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill. Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money. Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression. Where I am/Present day:
Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August. Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$
Dad has full-time job. Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs. Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now. Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months. Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Constant fights. Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone. Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much. Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor. Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings. This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my ""reality""; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies I don't think I can face reality head on. LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME
Get a full time job
Save some more. Get the fuck out. Don't want to enable my mental illnesses. HEART/BODY IS TELLING ME:
Slow down, take it easy, take care of your mental health FIRST. Be creative, use this free time to write and figure out life/career. Need emotional support. Fear I am heading towards a breakdown
I feel I always have to choose between them. To be honest I am leaning more towards my heart. I am not sure if it's my fear/mental issues talking or if it's actually what I want to do. The only real reason I am leaning towards my heart is, I never actually truly followed my heart. I always did what was expected of me, always was responsible, mature, put together. And for 5 years onward my programming/facade is breaking down. I always did my school work, hardly ever socialized, never got in trouble, always obeyed my parents. I was always smart with money, controlled, and careful. Got to college and all that I was, was questioned. I realized at 18 I was never actually truly happy. I did things because I thought that is what I should be doing than what I want to be doing. Negative thinking, social media, social community isolation (went away for college). Before I close this novel of a post; I just want to let you know that I am NOT/NEVER WAS SUICIDAL. I also don't think I am completely hopeless. I know I am smart responsible I just need help/time/emotional support and to not be soo hard on myself. Even so, I don't believe it (I know this is statement contradictory weird). I struggling with knowing believing. I know things/have insight, but I can't put them into believing/action. Anyway vent over (I got much more to say but this is HELLA long).",Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years.,1706,9,1

s_1499_927,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"I spent so long fighting to protect myself and my sister from my parents. Now that I've been free a while I realize I have no f*cking clue what to do about it. I'm in a Target parking lot with no clue what to do. Brief history: myself (25F) and my sister (22F) were raised by a pair of bipolar Ns who frequently switched between being and and Es. Both were on and off medication for mental health issues. I have always been fiercely protective of my younger sister, even though I was the SG and she was the GC and she didn't get picked on much. My parents would get violent but the second they raised a hand to my sister, I physically got in the way. Outwardly we were a great family - active in Girl Scouts and school stuff, super smart kids with a penchant for troublemaking, all very friendly, etc. Our parents worked in tandem - they'd egg each other on. We had many recoveries and relapses that therapy could not fix. Four and a half years ago my parents divorced and I moved in with the guy I'm about to marry. My parents are both still flaming Ns but I don't have to deal with them more than once a month (my mom) or three times a year (my dad, who replaced our family with a nearly-identical-to-us set of sisters and a single mother three hours away). Even after all that crap though, during my childhood my family was very close. We didn't have any cousins or anything so it was just us. We were poor most times and we stuck together, even if it was actually painful. I can't believe I fucking miss that. I miss my family. I miss my violent bipolar emotionally abusive mother and my aggressive opioid addicted father. I miss the good times - the camping trips between phases and the Disneyland days. Over the past four years I've held multiple jobs (nanny, personal assistant, cook, waitress, admin assistant, freelance artist, etc.) My current job is the longest I've ever held, at 9 months going on 10. I'm a nanny right now and I generally like what I do, even if my stress levels prevent me from being better at it. I live with my fianc in a tiny one bedroom apartment in the same city I grew up in. Nothing is changing for me. I don't want to go back to school, I don't want a desk job, I don't want to do anything. I feel like the constant encouragement then eventual tear down of any of my goals when I was younger has killed any dreams I've had. ("" I want to write for a magazine!"" My mom said. "" Except you'll be miserable and it's not a real job and it's too hard to get a job in that field"", she said.) I rarely see my family anymore, my sister and I see each other every few weeks and text maybe once a week. My fianc and I don't have many friends and we're about to start counseling (which I'm actually excited about) to fix some communication issues. We don't do much - he's overly financially conservative. We're actually going on a vacation I basically just booked and told him about, that I'm excited about. I'm partially disabled (degenerative spinal condition; no cure but mine is progressing very slowly which is cool). The littlest girl I nanny for asked me ""what are snails even trying to do?"". I'm that snail right now. I'm a snail in a target parking lot wondering what the fuck happened that made me realize I have no direction in life. I have become such a boring person. I am bored. I am tired. And I don't even have a reason to be tired because I don't do anything. I used to write, and I used to write well. I have nine half-finished novels on my laptop that I'm too ashamed to even open. I was basically just given a free pass to go to Target and go shopping because I had a really rough day at work - was late to pick up the kids, who were then misbehaving. I accidentally took their van keys home with me so had to drive half an hour back, then another half hour back to this stupid Target. I could get home in four minutes but what's the fucking point? And anyway, all I bought was Shampoo (I was out) and face wash (also out). I, the girl who can stress shop her way around ten Targets, couldn't be bothered to enjoy anything. So I guess I'll drive home. I still don't know what I'm going to do with my life but at least I don't need to go to a therapist to have the revelation that my parents completely destroyed my psyche.",And I don't even have a reason to be tired because I don't do anything.,3331,5,1

I'm just going to say this right now, I'm not some sort of Rachel Barry (Berry?) wanna-be or some sort of YouTube singer that has no talent or real aspiration, just looking for fame and money, no. I've been aspiring toward the theatres of Broadway since I can remember and I don't want any sort of fame or money. I just want to sing and be heard. And yes, I liked it before it was cool, and I'm fully aware that makes me sound like a hipster. Anyway, like I said, I just started high school, but I have all the expectation piled on me. Honestly and truthfully, I'm good. Some might say great or amazing, but I'm not trying to brag, I'm just letting you know. Because of this, I'm expected to be amazing and inspirational and all that, but I'm not. My mother expects me to get perfect grades, my sister expects me to get the lead in the musical as a freshman, my entire choir expects me to be perfect and on top of my game every day and never make a mistake and they think it's okay to put all the attention on me sometimes when it makes me uncomfortable (because come one, it's a choir), and it goes on and on and on. I can't handle it. I know my limits and my abilities, but noone else does. I'm supposed to be perfect. When I make an achievement, noone cares because it's expected. When I break down, it's just not okay, I'm supposed to handle all of this. When I make a bad grade, my mother tells me that I won't get into college. When I make a good one, it doesn't affect her. I, honest to God, got a 101% in French (granted, it's only the first half of the first quarter), but she was unimpressed because the rest of my grades weren't quite there. They're all B's and A's, and again: I. Just. I'm breaking down. When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. All of my friends had abandoned me for a dumb reason I'm not willing to get into and my parents thought I didn't need help. Every time I reached out to someone for help, they thought I was lying, or be overly-dramatic. I had three failed suicide attempts. ( Note: I AM NOT CURRENTLY SUICIDAL. THIS WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.) Finally, my principal caught wind of my situation somehow and decided to suspend me until I got medical help. ( Just saying, she's a bitch. Never, ever force anyone with a mental problem to get help against their will.) I went to a therapist, I went to the hospital. My parents were in shock. They thought I could handle my own problems. They didn't realize my mom not being there and my dad's abusive, alcoholic, depressive behavior had rubbed off on me. They still don't. They blame everything all on my own inability to take care of myself. I got out three days before my thirteenth birthday. Now here I am, going down a scary path again. The only friends I can get right now and mean to me, selfish, and expect me to be perfect, my parents are ignoring me, and I have all these.... expectations. I'm not okay.

I was doing cardio every day. I stopped smoking and drinking. The last couple weeks I've found myself really tired. It's hard for me to motivate myself to exercise and I'm spending more time in bed napping. I think that my hormone levels are really low because my dosage is really low.

But for the first time in my life, I'm on my way there. Sorry for the wall of text. So I've been a fatty fatty boombalatty for my entire adult life. Lots of cognitive dissonance and ignorance towards health caused my situation. At the start of this year, I was 285 lbs as a 5""10 27 yo male. 3 months ago I decided enough was enough. So I did something about it, I did my research and came to realise that **WEIGHT LOSS IS EASY**. It's so simple, I was wondering why I ever convinced myself otherwise. ** Calories in vs calories out**. That's it. No fads, no pills and believe it or not; no exercise required. ( definitely recommended though. Diet is for weight loss; exercise is for health). I did my calculations, I saw what my daily calorie expenditure was and I started eating under that magic number every day. I quit drinking and started being a little bit more active. Wouldn't you know it, after 1 week of this I lose almost 4 pounds. Fucking magic right? I think where most people fail is by seeing this as a *diet*. Diet implies a temporary change to allow you to go back to your original lifestyle - **this is why diets fail**. Your lifestyle needs to change **forever**. Another fairly common assumption is that you can no longer enjoy the foods you currently enjoy and you have to eat nothing but 'healthy foods'. ** This is total and complete bullshit**. My diet has not change all that much, I just eat less. Now saying all of that, you do want to add more balance to your diet. So definitely eat more fruit and vegetables - but don't think you need to have a dinner which consists of a plate of lettuce. That's just silly. You know what my favourite dinner is? A nice juicy porter house steak with a side of pasta salad and salad/veges. For me that's around a <PHONE> calorie meal and christ is it tasty. Once you get your food intake undercontroll, you'd be surprised at how this affects your life. A better diet means better sleep which means better energy, which actually makes you **want** to exercise. Crazy right? As I said, it's been 3 months and I've lost 33 pounds.

s_835_14,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Unexplained Incident in New Haven Greetings everyone. My name is Dwayne. I'm a state trooper out of New Haven Connecticut. I've been on the force for almost 20 years and a few months back something strange happened that I've not been able to shake. I've always been a bit of a drinker but ever since that night things have been bad. I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day. I'm hoping that maybe sharing this with someone will help. I can only imagine what my ex would say, so I'm turning towards the anonymous internet instead. It was a fair day and I was cruising down 95 heading back to the station when I got the call. ""Young woman causing a scene crossing interstate 95."" This was the entirety of the report. I called in to get the mile marker and found that I was relatively close. I had been in a hurry to get off of work that day to see my daughter, but frankly the idea of seeing her mother was enough to encourage my to respond. I called in that I was on my way and headed toward the reported scene. This internet age is crazy. Before I even reached the location I was watching a Youtube video of a young girl running and spinning in circles in the middle of the highway. Sammy at dispatch had texted the link partially so I would know what was happening, but mostly because Sammy was a bored busy-body who loved gossip and glamorization. Regardless, by the time I reached the scene I immediately recognized her. She was hard to miss. She was half naked, with the rags of a white camisole as her only protection against the elements. She was crouched with her shoulder pressed alongside the concrete barrier and frantically peeking over, and then ducking back down. I positioned my car to protect her from the flow of traffic and called in my position. I carefully got out of the car, and approached her a gently as I could. I had spent years dealing with domestic disputes, which more often than not, included some paranoid, drug addled husband. The state of this woman looked very familiar, and I knew not to provoke someone as high as she must have been. She saw me coming from long off and locked eyes with mine as I, step by step, got closer. I held my hands low, palms down, showing that I was not a threat. I was good at this and it worked. She let me get within speaking distance without becoming startled, though her eyes were wild and full of trepidation. ""Sweetheart, I'm here to help you."" She ignore me, instead popping her head up and looking over the barrier to the opposite side of the highway. I looked and saw nothing. ""You're in danger, young lady""
She spun her head to eyeball me intensely. she whispered forcefully. Let me help you. Get into the car and we'll leave."" I walked towards the car, looking over my shoulder to see her positioning and preparing to follow me like a cat. The moment my door was open she darted from her position and was in the back seat of my cruiser faster than I would have imagined possible. I pulled away and headed back to the station, all the while looking at her in my rear view. She was cut, bruised, scraped and clearly not well. She kept darting from one window to another looking for something. ""You're going to be ok now. Can you tell me what happened?"" ""They're coming."" She was distracted, still on the lookout. ""Did someone hurt you? Are they here?"" I slowed the car a bit in case the perp was in the local vicinity. She did not answer, yet her answer was clear. She was obviously worried about being found by the people who hurt her. I called into dispatch telling them that I had secured the girl, and that I was on my way back now. She completely flipped out. She started kicking the seat behind me, spinning her body and screaming. They'll hear! They'll find us!"" tears were streaming down her cheeks. You're safe with me. They won't be able to hurt you. Do they have a police scanner? Is that what you mean?"" I was now starting to realize that this girl might not be crazy or drugged. Her eyes were clear, and although highly disturbed, she did not seem to have the classic signs of a tweaker. ""They will hear."" She lowered her voice, looking into my eyes in the mirror. No more radio. We'll get you back to the station."" She calmed a bit and fumbled with her hands between her knees. We only had a few minutes left until we reached the station and the detectives would take over. My curiosity got the better of me and I continued to ask questions. I knew that this was perhaps my only chance to actually figure out what was happening, and frankly the idea of tracking down the scum that hurt this young girl was exciting. ""Who did this. Do you know where they are?"" ""Elsewhere. They took me. They took me long ago and.... it's different. That place. They found me, and they're looking again.... to take me back, to take me."" She was slow and despondent now. ""What does it look like, the place? ""It's... It's bad, and purple. It comes in waves but they hurt. They pull at you, tearing. And the flashes, they... they pull too... but... your brain, your eyes."" This was getting nowhere fast. I decided that I was not likely to get any legitimate information at this point and stopped. My silence was interrupted by her fresh screams. She held her temples with the palms of her hands, fingers extended, shouting ""They're here now, they found me!"" Over her deranged shouting I heard the break of my radio, and answered it. ""Car 19, this is dispatch, what's you're location?"" This was so routine as to be automatic for me. I looked out the drivers side window to check and replied instantly. ""Mile marker 36."" Then something stuck me. "" ""Sammy, that you?"". I got nothing in return. "" And then it was too silent. I looked in my rear view to nothing but an empty seat. I jammed my breaks and pulled to the breakdown lane, and ran out of the car. I checked the back thoroughly to find nothing. She was just.... gone. There was no sign she'd ever even been there. I came back to the station empty handed. I was questioned about what was going on. I told them the truth. I told them every single part of what I'm telling you. What I got in return was a 3 week leave, and to never be looked at without concern since. I still have my career, but no one on the force treats me the same. I don't treat myself the same. I learned on that day that there was something enormous and unexplained among us. I was no threat to it, probably not even a consideration compared to that. But ""that"" exists. My reality is theirs. They are here, and there is nothing I can do about it. I just pray that they never want me.","I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day.",333,0,1

s_201_13,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Had a very bad break down in school today. Not even sure I can make it through the night. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have *nothing* going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not *you*. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even *really* express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...
I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...

Is she cheating?** So a week ago I opened our closet and noticed that the box where we keep our sex toys looked different. I looked inside and noticed there were 3 things missing. Asked my girlfriend about it, she said she didn't know anything about it somewhat later she then said she took them out and put them somewhere else. When I asked her where she said she forgot where and she would search for them. When I asked her again yesterday, she got angry and said she had no time for looking and was dodging questions. Today I searched for myself. Didn't find them but I found some ovulation tests. We don't plan to get kids. Is there any other reason that shes using these tests? Like medical reasons? ( She has a history with HPV) Or is she cheating? She's not at home right now and I'm getting crazy so I'm asking her before I look like an idiot when I'm asking her tonight. Not a native speaker so sorry for my english Edit. I should have mentioned that we didn't have sex for about a month now and I found these tests in her backpack she uses when shes sleeping at friends Edit 2:When I tried to talk to her calmly about the toys she got really angry fast and left the room. And about asking the friends. Half the time I don't even know at which friends house she is. When I ask her she says stuff like : some girls I met at soccer practices or at a party. Last Sunday when I asked her where she's going she misspoke the name of a friend that I know. She then told me that she always calls her that name (I never head her call her friend that so that was weird too Update: Hours ago my now ex girlfriend came home and after reading the comments on my post I felt like an paranoid idiot, so I decided to drop it. She acted really weird when she came home and I noticed that she had something in her hand when she came out of the toilet and went to our bedroom. Immediately my inner alarm went off and as soon as she left the bedroom I was looking for what she's hiding. I found a used ovulation test and another package with one pill that was missing under her pants under a pillow. I took a picture and after searching the name from the package on Google it's an emergency contraceptive called ellaone. .. [ <URL>](<URL>) I was fucking shocked and disgusted when I read that and I still am. So I immediately went to her and asked about the toys again and why there are these ovulation test under her bed. Before she could lie to me I just told her that I know that she just took that pill. She started fucking laughing, I told her that this is absolutely not funny in any way. She told me to let her alone but I was so mad that I just asked her the same fucking questions until she started crying. She accused me of hacking her phone, that I was spying on her, that I'm the bad one until she finally told me the truth. About a month ago she messaged one of her coaches on Instagram because of some sport lotion and where to get it and all that. They exchanged numbers, kept chatting and started to meet. So the sleepovers were indeed them fucking. When I asked about the toys she just said that I would know where they are and she had the tests because they fucked without protection. She now wants me to leave the apartment and told me that she already had legal advice weeks ago and that I have 1 month to leave because I'm just the subtenent. Knowing that she already planned this makes me so incredibly sick. She's gone now and I feel like I'm dead. I'm not sad or angry I just feel nothing right now. 5 years wasted for nothing. How can someone be this fucking cold I just don't understand. We moved about two years ago to a different city because she wanted to study here. I don't have friends here where I can live until I find something. I don't have a family and 1 month to find a home in one of the busiest cities in Germany. I never thought that I get cheated on.

I have in fact been in a very similar situation to the one you describe and I'm merely asking you to look a little deeper than the surface issues in an attempt to figure out a solution. For the past few years I had been having issues with my partner, he would rarely initiate and would never reciprocate if I did, making me feel unwanted and undesirable, I gained weight, lost my fitness level, I blamed it all on the lack of sex, I became fixated in the sex I wasn't having. Then I was diagnosed with major depression. It wasn't the lack of sex and feeling undesirable that made me gain the weight, it was that I'd stopped caring about everything, stopped dancing, singing, going to the gym, all the things I had loved and had kept me physically healthy. I was suffering from the effects of personal and vicarious trauma due to the work I do. My mood was very low, I was prone to anxiety attacks and inappropriate emotional reactions. I finally got help, medication and therapy, and now things are starting to normalise, our sex life has returned, we've even done it twice in one day! Unheard of before. It turned out that my moods were affecting him as well. I'm not saying that this is the issue, all I'm saying is to look a little deeper and stop playing the games (like the one where you stopped touching her boobs altogether because she asked you not to while the kids are around-which, while it would totally not bother me, is a pretty normal and healthy boundary to draw) Start trying to see things from her perspective.","For the past few years I had been having issues with my partner, he would rarely initiate and would never reciprocate if I did, making me feel unwanted and undesirable, I gained weight, lost my fitness level, I blamed it all on the lack of sex, I became fixated in the sex I wasn't having.",323,1,1

I was fairly emotional during high school, like a lot of kids, but most of the time I still didn't feel like my head was really in it. I very nearly flunked out, but continuation school and my mom threatening to kick me out at 15 got me to finish. I dabbled in college courses, but never went back and I don't think I earned more than three units in something like three semesters. I had thought it would be a new beginning, something I could dive into, head first, but I hated it. I hated the people, the professors, the coursework. I had always wanted to be a writer, a novelist, but my passion for writing started to die off around that time. It's been a slow, shitty descent since then.

I felt nothing, nothing, nothing, and then one morning I woke up and I felt everything all at once, a glimmer of happiness among waves of crushing sadness, white-hot anger, so bad I wanted to smash things, break things. That very afternoon, I was back to nothingness, or near-nothingness. You know how it is. Sometimes you feel little things throughout the day that almost make you feel like you're having a good day, until you look back on the week behind you and literally cared so less about it, in hindsight, that you can't remember a damn thing that happened. I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist, I know I should be medicated. But I procrastinate and I feel like, what, going and talking to someone and taking pills is going to magically fix me? And I'll be able to commit to things and feel normal? That's never going to happen, for me, so why bother? I just feel like I'm spending my life waiting to get better when that may never happen, and what then? I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to just go back to sleep, to pass the time. The monotony of daily life is stifling. I do look forward to weekends, to getting things done and deflating and just spending some time with my guy, but as soon as Sunday morning hits and I realize it's basically back to the work week again, I lose whatever grip on normalcy I might have had. I'm just so, so tired. Of everything.","I just feel like I'm spending my life waiting to get better when that may never happen, and what then?",3479,0,1
s_2840_562,Find evidence for appetite change in this post,"I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful. Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still ""the weird fat girl"" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends. About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to ""protect me"" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him. I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle. Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit.","I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time.",5276,2,1

before that I tried to be a functioning adult with a 'real' job. I was having nervous breakdowns panic attacks
my panic attacks just got worse as I got older. I'm on meds for anxiety but they only take the edge off, they don't help me function in the way I need to. I've been in a number of relationships, that all are basically variants of the same relationship over over.

s_1135_282,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"This is my story. A story I've never told a single soul, not family, not even my closest friends. You're the first. But it starts around the time I was 10-11. A bit of history on me first, I was a very lonely child. I never had many friends, I just kept to myself and found ways to make use of my time. So as you may imagine, I had quite a few imaginary friends growing up. I mean, it's just something you do when you're a kid. So among these friends, I had some animals, some people, just someone, or really anyone that I could talk to. But there was one in particular, one... /thing/ that stands out among all my friends. He's the reason for this story. I called him Steve, although he never gave me his name. But since he never protested Steve, I guess it stuck. He was tall and very thin, only about 6 feet tall now that I think about it, but he seemed so much taller when I was just a boy. He was quite pale, and his eyes were dark and sunk into his head, like someone who was in their final stages of a terminal illness. He always wore the same clothes though, it was this dark trench coat looking thing, with a black suit underneath. One thing that I remember most, although I didn't think about it when I was younger, was that he never spoke, or even so much as opened his mouth. His mouth. That's another thing about him. Although he never opened his mouth, I never really wanted him to. There was something about it that frightened me, just an odd shape about it. You know how if you take something familiar that you see all the time, and you change it ever so slightly to the point that it becomes something unfamiliar, and even disturbing? It was like that. It seemed to be just a tiny bit longer than a normal mouth, and it was always in a twisted sort of smile, almost as if he were mocking you. And he never opened it, but I just knew there was something terrible behind those pale, twisted lips. Maybe some huge, terrible teeth, like those alien-looking fish you see on those nature shows about the deep ocean. Whatever lie behind those lips, I knew I never wanted to see it. But moving on, there's another thing about me you should know. About the age of 11, my family life started to fall apart. My parents were always fighting, my siblings were always picking on me, and I was bullied at school with no end in sight. Eventually it became too much, and one day I just couldn't handle it anymore. So I hurt myself. I took a razor blade I found in my mom's medicine cabinet, and I just ran it across my arm and watched it bleed. It felt good. To this day, I'll never understand how it felt good, but it did. The quick, sharp pain in my arm just drowned out all the other pain in my life, at least for a while. But if I had known what it would do to me, I never would've done it. It became something I needed, something my body craved. It hurt me even worse if I DIDN'T cut myself. I couldn't stop, and eventually I had to wear long sleeves to school so that people didn't see. But the first time I did it, the first time I looked at myself in the mirror after releasing all that pain, that was the first time I saw him. He just stood in the doorway and smiled at me, while glancing at the fresh blood dripping down my arm
. Perhaps that's why he became my best friend, because he was there the time I needed someone the most, but nobody came. Except for him. He was there, every time I needed someone, every time I cut my arm or my leg, he was always there, smiling at me, looking at my freshest cut with a strange bewilderment in his eyes. Sometimes I would accidentally go a little deeper, and he would smile extra big, and sometimes even give me a quick thumbs up, as if he knew how much pleasure the pain brought, and wanted to encourage me. After about a year or so of this, I started seeing him other places too. At school, in the store, even in passing cars when we would drive down the road. But he wasn't looking at me, he would look at other people, just stare at them. He only seemed to look at me when I hurt myself. You may find this childish, but I got very jealous of that simple truth. And I would even hurt myself more often, and worse, just so I could get him to look at me more often when nobody else would. And as it went on, I noticed he had a different look in his eyes as he watched me. Almost as if he were beckoning me to come with him, to be with him, wherever he was from. It was the same look a father gives his son when it's time to go home after a long day on the playground, but at the same time, it was the same look a father gives his son when he's just gotten in trouble and it's time to come home without question. Then after a few years of this, around age 15, I made the biggest mistake of my life. I attempted to kill myself. I had no idea what I was doing, even made a few google searches just to figure out how I would do it, but I decided I couldn't take life anymore, seeing as my parents had now divorced, my mom hardly even noticed me unless I got in trouble, and the siblings that stayed with me and mom all hated my guts. It seemed like Steve was the only person who cared, who wanted me as I was. So I decided I would go home with him. I decided to fashion a noose out of some rope I had in my closet, and I hung it from my ceiling fan. After saying prayer upon prayer, and crying every drop of moisture I had in my body, I finally decided I was ready. I slowly slipped the noose around my neck, and I saw him standing there. I looked straight into his dark, sunken eyes, and then I just let my body fall upon the rope. It wasn't anything like I had expected, it was literally the worst agony I'd ever experienced. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't scream, I couldn't think, I just kept getting dizzier and dizzier, and it was all total confusion for those few seconds which felt like hours in themselves. But a few seconds in, I noticed that Steve was walking closer to me. I had never realized it before this moment, but he never walked, or even moved anything more than his eyes when I saw him. He just kind of appeared when I needed him. But this time, he walked toward me. And as I looked at his face for what I thought would be the final time, it was different. He was /laughing/ at me. My only friend in the world, the one person I could always depend on, and he was feeding off all my pain, everything important in my life, and making a mockery of it. He had wanted this all along, he had tricked me. And too late I finally saw where I had gone wrong in accepting his simple gesture of ""love"", his smile which I mistook for kindness, that turned out to be nothing but a malicious ploy for my very soul. And as he laughed and looked me in the eye, I saw his mouth open for the first, last, and only time. There was nothing. No teeth, no tongue, no black, no white, just absolute nothingness. In that instant, I knew that I had just caught a glimpse of my impending doom. I had made my foolish choice. I tried to look away, I tried to close my eyes, but his gaze held me in a viselike grip, unable to look away until he was mere inches from my face, his sneer slowly twisting into a fiendish laugh that sounded as if it was coming from the fiery pits of hell itself. And that brief moment, that one second was all it took. I now knew that I was face to face with Death, the devil himself, my ""friend"". So with my last breath, I closed my eyes and grabbed the rope, and I pulled down with all my might, hoping I could break the fan and free myself from his deathly gaze. I opened my eyes as I heard the snap of splintering wood as the fan broke, the rope fell, and suddenly all clarity rushed back into my head, and Steve was gone. For good. I never saw Steve again, and that was nearly 10 years ago now. I never cut myself or attempted to kill myself again, for fear that I would look up and see HIM. His icy cold stare, his suit as black as the moonless night, his dastardly sneer, and the nothing that lie behind it. I buried this memory in the deepest recesses of my mind, hoping it was all just a dream, my imagination. But today I saw something that changed how I saw the incident. I was browsing the internet, and I came across a post made by someone talking about their imaginary friends, and one of them I had realized bore a striking resemblance to Steve. Upon closer investigation, the person had an eerily similar experience with Steve. It was at that moment, when the icy chills ran up and down my spine, that I realized that Steve was not my imaginary friend at all. He was certainly not my friend, I had known that for years now, but now I knew that he was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, NOT imaginary. And so I write this as a warning, if you see Steve, whatever his name may be, in his black suit and coat, his pale skin, dark eyes, and that horrifically twisted smile, you need to stop what you're doing to draw him in, stop bringing pain upon yourself, and don't let him get any closer to you. Or else you could fail where I succeeded, you may end up in his prison of emptiness. You may be what lies behind his smile.",I attempted to kill myself.,4752,8,1

For the next 5 days, I checked the mailbox to see if it happened to come in early but walked back into my house with a slight feeling of sadness. I just really wanted more people to pay attention to me. As a bisexual male that never got the attention of either gender I wanted, no needed, something to help me obtain some sort of romance. Im 29 years old and I havent even gone on a date before. I havent had my first kiss before. I sucked a dick back in college, but the guy never called me back or even acknowledged my presence after that. Yesterday evening when I came back from work I checked my mailbox and found a small brown box inside. I grabbed the box and ran back inside of my house. I excitedly tore open the box and a piece of paper fell out. On the top it said Instructions and right below it was only one simple sentence. One spray every 3 days. I took the small bottle out of the box and looked it over. Inside of the bottle was a thicker clear liquid. Whenever I moved the bottle the liquid slowly moved towards whatever direction the bottle was at. I set it down on the table and watched the liquid slowly settle back down. I wondered how it would come out of the bottle so I uncapped it and sprayed myself in the neck. When the liquid hit me in the neck I let out a loud gasp. It felt like water hitting my neck, but I could feel the liquid moving. I dont really know how to explain it any better other than that it felt like the liquid dug into my pores. I tried to rub out whatever was left, but my neck was completely dry. I could feel myself start to panic so I took a couple of deep breaths and started to rationalize with myself. Im just tired. Cologne does tend to dry up as soon as it touches any type of skin. The liquid was not moving. Maybe it was just running a little bit because I sprayed so close to my neck. After I managed to calm myself down I ordered a pizza. I was hungry and curious now. Whoever came up to the door will definitely be affected by the cologne if it is real. 40 minutes later someone rang my doorbell. A 30 something-year-old guy was standing outside with a pizza in his hands. I walked up closer to him and asked him what the total was. With a look of confusion on his face, he told me that it would be $14.19. I asked him if there was anything else I could pay him with, and to my excitement, his face started to go from confused to somewhat turned on. I grabbed him by his arm and pulled him inside. I wont go into details, but I got a free pizza. He was a biter which I liked, but at times he bit a little too hard. I didnt care. I loved it. I woke up this morning to see another person lying next to me for the first time. I gave him a little kiss on the cheek and he woke up. I asked him if he wanted breakfast and he nodded his head. While I was in the kitchen making some eggs and bacon he walked into the kitchen and told me that he was fired last night. He also told me that this was his first time ever doing anything with another guy. I laughed and told him to sit down. After breakfast, he started to look a little distant. He kept being short whenever I asked him a question, and by 2 pm he snuck out of my house while I used the restroom. It didnt really make me sad, though. I mean there are plenty other people around where I live. Take, for example, the lovely brunette that lives 3 doors down. I had a crush on her for the past 2 years, but I never had the courage to even talk to her. That is when I messed up. I grabbed the bottle of cologne and sprayed my neck two more times. It felt like the liquid went inside of my pores again, but this time I was fine with it. I walked over to her house and knocked on her door. When she opened her door she looked at me for a second and asked me if I lived a couple houses down from her. I laughed and told her that I did and that my vacuum cleaner just broke down. She gave me a little laugh and told me that she would go get hers for me. I was overflowing with confidence that moment. Without a second thought, I took off my shoes and walked into her house. I walked up to the little hallway she walked into and saw that she was pulling the vacuum out of a small closet. I walked up to her and hugged her from behind. She jumped up in surprise and shoved me off, but after a couple of seconds, she noticed my smell. She walked back up to me and slowly licked my cheek before I blacked out. It was nighttime when I regained consciousness. Pain erupted from all over my face. I got up from the bed and walked out the bedroom door. The girl was lying on the ground snoring. Her mouth was covered in blood. I bolted out of her house and ran back home. My cell phone was charging on my living room sofa next to the bottle of cologne. I grabbed the phone and dialed 911. I saw my face from the front facing camera on my phone. Most of my face has been torn off. There are bite marks around each gash on my face. There is almost nothing covering the bottom of my right eye. My cheeks are pretty much gone. Im in the hospital now. The doctors asked me if I remembered anything, but I remained silent. I cant blame her for this. I can only blame myself. Im here to give you all a warning. If you find a pheromone spray called Lust Enhancer get it. It really works, but please only spray once.",I can only blame myself.,5671,6,1

He never told me. His mom said something vague about something between them, so I asked my boyfriend, and he said he just thought about it and had a very ""caught"" look on his face. I didn't believe him so I turned to facebook, messaged said girl, and asked her what really happened. She said that while she was staying the night at their house, they stayed up late watching a movie, and instead of going upstairs my boyfriend got into her bed with her and kissed her. She said after that she told him to leave, because she felt sorry for me. I never would've thought that anything would ever go on between them, ever. I've been around her plenty of times, and I never noticed anything between them previous to this. After about a week of thinking things through and talking with my boyfriend, I decided that I still wanted to be with him. He said that he was just horny and lonely, since at the time of the incident I had been away for two months. Then, last night, I asked him if he wants to go to bed with me (we live in his parents house and have separate bedrooms but usually sleep together), but he said that he had to stay up late to work on a paper. About 20 minutes later I go back into his room to borrow his charger, and I saw him go through about 10 photos of a pretty Korean girl on facebook. I asked him calmly what he was doing and he looked ""caught"" again and said that she was just a girl from school and that there were other people from his class in the photos too. The problem is, I know he has a thing for asian girls. He always has since I've known him (since he was 11 years old), and I've seen him looking at them plenty of times, whether it be at school, on facebook, or even when I came across a file of porn he had saved titled ""Asian Girls"". He is white and I'm only a quarter filipino, so I look white for the most part. After a week break/when we were talking through stuff, he admitted, on three occasions that I knew about but had never got a straight answer from him, that he liked three different girls (all asian) in the past, while we were together. All three girls were in relationships at the time. I think if he had the chance, something would have definitely happened... Anyway, I looked him in the eyes after he replied, and asked him to please be honest with me. He told me that she was a friend of a friend that he just noticed her in a profile picture, and decided to look through her profile bc he thought she was pretty. It just made me feel like shit. I'm glad he was honest, but I can't help it. I'll never look like all the girls he's always looking at/is interested in. It's taken a serious toll on my self-esteem. I don't know what to do at this point. It seems like this behavior will never end. However, I know he's young and so am I, and we've never been in a real relationship with anyone besides each other. I've never had a desire to be with anyone else while we we've been together. I've asked him multiple times why he wants to be in a relationship with me when it's obvious he wants to experience other people, but his response is always, ""I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't know. I love you"". I think he just has a problem with being lonely, and he likes the affection that I'm always giving him. I think it's hard for him to not have that, and maybe he's scared that he won't find/it will be a while before he does. If he finds someone while he's with me, then it would be easier for him. He'd just leave me and wouldn't have to have any lonely ""in-between"" time. He's going to Japan for a month and I don't trust him at all. I just don't know what to believe from him anymore. I always have to drag the truth out of him, and even then, I still can't tell if he's truly being honest with me. I can't imagine being without him. It kills me to think about it. But I'm wondering now if it's because leaving him would be a huge change for me. I live in Washington with him and his parents, and breaking up would probably mean going back to California to live with my family, which I don't really want to do. I talked to his mom about it and she said that I could still live here, but I think it would be too uncomfortable. Even though I told him to please leave me alone right now, he's been coming into my room and telling me he loves me and stuff, when I asked him not to come in without permission. We've been together so long, and he's all I know... I don't really have any other friends. This is probably one of the toughest decisions I've had to make thus far in my life, and I am so lost as to what to do. tl;dr: My boyfriend kissed another girl last summer, never told me about it. He's also constantly interested in other (asian) girls while he's been with me, and I'm not sure if this behavior will ever end. We've never been in a relationship with anyone besides each other, so I think he just wants to experience other people, but has never admitted to it. I can't imagine being with anyone else.

I was never a church goer or Bible beater by any means, but certainly had the feeling that something greater created us and there was a reason for this life. At times I've cussed and screamed at him that I hated him for the pain in my life. I've totally turned and lost faith at times as well. The faith I have now is rooted in a near/post death experience during a suicide attempt a few months back. I ate an entire month's supply of blood pressure medication and layed down to die. I'm actually still processing a lot of what happened and what I was shown and the knowledge and Undescribable, unconditional Love God has for ALL OF US. GOD IS LOVE, and we are all OF GOD, and we are ALL part of each other.. We are creators as well. Time is an illusion, but I spent what would be the equivalent of a couple weeks in God's Glory and kingdomthere's ways you can go too without dying(I don't recommend it) Believe it or not, we actually CHOSE this life and most of the tragedy in it. We even chose how we die. I know right?!?! WTF WERE WE THINKING?!?! I can't sit here and write the book in one sitting, but I'll bless you with some knowledge. The MEANING OF LIFE"" is something everyone wants to know, and it's a lot simpler than we all think. This life, on Earth, is not our first and won't be our last. The people closest to us have traveled with us before, and we made contracts with them for this lifetime. Earth life is a SCHOOL. It teaches one collective lesson that is truly important. HOW TO LOVE AND HOW TO BE LOVED. There's no graduating with a 4.0 either. There IS HOWEVER a pass/fail kind of thing, and if we fail ourselves or our loved ones, we gotta come back and do it again until we get it right. We also have an individual PURPOSE. This is different than meaning"". It could be as simple as a stranger watching us perform a random act of kindness and inspiring a ripple effect that goes on paying it forward for a very long time. It could be as profound as curing a disease or stopping a war. I wasn't told my purpose, but I know it's found by knowing the MEANING and loving people the best you can and accepting the love they give back. I was introduced to a soul I'd never met before I came backby choiceand she told me her name on Earth. I'd never heard this name before EVER, but it was so familiar to me when I awoke that it was etched into my mind. She said if I have questions about the afterlife to read her work, but to take it with a grain of salt because she didn't get all of it right, and that me having her name it would verify to me that what I experienced was real. Go on YouTube and listen to some of her lectures. I did, and I instantly started crying tears of extreme joy and my connection to God has never been stronger. With all the research I've done on folks that have experienced what I did, they're all VERY SIMILAR. Peter Panagore is a minister that had a very SIMILAR(not exact) NDE as mine. My story is very complicated, and though I chose to come back, I made a mistake. Ive woken up every morning in complete agony and heartbreak. I'm a pretty tough guy who, until now, hasn't cried a lot. I've cried for 7 strait months.. I'm putting g a stop to it and going home, but for those of you remaining here in this school of love, RememberI LOVE YOU! GOD LOVES YOU WAY MORE, and don't forget that. It's one more person than some people have, so go out there. Do something for someone else you don't know and don't expect a thing back. I don't care if you volunteer at a homeless shelter or give a homeless person a few dollars. Go to an old folks home and just spend some time talking to people that don't have anyone ever come see them. You pick, but you'll be AMAZED at how beautiful life becomes.

s_186_136,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"The place Im looking at for surgery doesn't recommend lap bands anymore. They also don't recommend or do duodenal switches as far as I have heard. I THINK, it's because the results aren't as good. But also because it's a foreign object in your body and if you dislodge it or have complications they have to operate to remove it and usually dont put another one in due to trauma or whatever caused by the one that came loose. I know of at least one person who had the lap band and had major complications with it, resulting in them having a herniated stomach, where the stomach moves up into the ribcage area. And then because of that, the bile of the stomach would collect in their esophagus when they slept....
They are getting a gastric sleeve as a replacement for the removal of the lap band to go along with the surgery to fix the herniation. Im looking at getting the gastric sleeve, I am......150-200 pounds over my ""goal weight"" depending on where I want to end up. Your weight loss should be based on your BMI as well, a short person 70 pounds over weight is worse off than a very tall person 100 pounds overweight. The tall (man presumably) is going to lose the weight faster just due to their size and will take less a calorie cut to see results. Where a short woman will have to cut pretty significantly to see results most likely. Also my surgery choice also does not recommend exercise at first if you are higher on the BMI scale because of possible injuries. I think it also helps you to better determine a diet you will lose weight on no matter what. Then add in exercise when you feel your energy levels and ability to more easily carry the rest of the weight increase. A number of people post surgery talk about their energy levels being crazy high, I guess due to the hormone changes and more protein intense diet. But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released. Plus you don't get those little ""food highs"" if you cut out your trigger foods. For surgery, IF you struggle to lose and keep weight off, get the surgery. It'll depend on your BMI, but if you keep going back and forth, eventually you're going to get tired of it and say screw it. Plus wouldn't you like to be skinnier and healthier, earlier rather than later? I wish I had the option 10 years ago, and so does everyone else I've talked to. They wish they could have did it much earlier in life and the majority of them say ""I was fat for as long as I can remember."" Or at least since their teens, it's no way to live if you're unhappy with it and it only gets worse as you age and your body starts to have medical issues due to it.","But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released.",1833,5,1

Who was going to become now? Was I going to become someone evil? The feeling of depression made me think my soul was gone rotten. I started reading the bible to learn how to live properly, but all I could see was condemnation and I became convinced I was going to hell. A particular line where Jesus says something like 'you shouldn't even imagine being with your neighbour's wife because it's the same as doing it' (I'm paraphrasing) convinced me to think a sinful thought was the same as committing that sin. I thought, ok, I must not think any sinful thoughts. Which of course, sparked them off. Everytime I had a violent thought I freaked out and tried to suppress it or pulverise that part of my mind. All this just made the thoughts stronger and more persistent.

I am sure a lot of people would be curious as to how that felt so let me start from how I got there. I tried to be a good person, but my horrible temper always got in the way. It was to the point to where I no longer had friends. My family stopped talking to me, including my own mother, father, and two sisters. I was only 21 years old, but I was truly alone. I tried to blame everyone around me, but I knew, deep down, that it was my own fault. Enough of my sob story. Let me tell you how I died. I got off of my shift at the local grocery store and was walking back home. On the way home, a man walked up to me and asked, Hey man, could you spare some cash? I lost my job a couple of days ago and I need to get some type of food for my kids. He pointed at a hungry boy and girl sitting behind him, but I scoffed and said, Not that hard to get a job. Why did you even procreate when youre fucking trash? I gave him a quick chuckle and walked past him when I felt pain erupt from my lower back. The next couple of seconds were filled with a knife plunging into my chest. I dont know when I blacked out, but the next thing I remember was opening my eyes and seeing a woman sitting close to my head and saying, Stay calm. Were almost there. Stay with-. I blacked out again and before I knew it I was met by a sense of absolute peace. Before I opened my eyes, I knew I was floating. When I opened my eyes I saw myself floating through a fog of memories. Through the fog, I could see myself yelling and cussing out my parents a year ago before storming out of their house. That was the last time I saw them. The next thing I saw was the time I was pulled over by the cops with my best friend since we were 6, Brad. He was there for me whenever I needed someone the most, but I took advantage of that. When a cop pulled us over I took out the 7 grams of coke out of my pocket and threw it on the car seat behind me. Brad looked at me with pleading eyes while the cops cuffed him, but I acted oblivious to everything. I closed my eyes again and did not open them until I felt solid ground under my feet. With a deep sigh, I opened my eyes and saw around 20 to 30 people standing in front of me. I looked down and saw that we were standing on a clear glass of some sort. When I looked back up I saw that I was next in line. I rushed up to a man that stood in front of the largest gate I have ever seen in my life. The gate was simple, but it looked to be made of solid gold. After ogling at the gate for a couple of seconds I looked down at the man in front of me. He was maybe a little over 4 feet tall, poorly maintained facial hair that covered half of his face, and eyes filled with sadness and disappointment. I opened my mouth to ask him who he was, but before I could get a sound out he spoke in a raspy voice, Nathan Cliff, enter through the gates. Although I was confused, I rushed through the gates and looked around. A road paved with gold, bodies made of solid light walking around everywhere, and other people walking around with dreamy expressions on their faces. Besides the people that walked around me, everything around me was a mixture of absolutely pure light. Something far brighter and crisper than anything I have ever seen. The only thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was a man dressed in all red with a piece of paper. Written on the piece of the paper was the date. Somehow, whenever the man flipped the paper over it gave the date of the next day, and an endless swarm of people surrounded the man. The first 50 years passed by quickly. I met a lot of other people, we talked about our lives, but I quickly became bored. You can only talk to so many people before their lives start sounding the same. We never grew hungry, tired, or thirsty, but it never ended my cravings. I wanted to get a good nights rest. I wanted to eat just one carrot and savor all of the taste. I wanted to quench a thirst with a cool glass of water, but all we had was each other and those damn angels that never said a word to anyone. For the next 110 years, I reflected back on my life. It may seem like a long time to think about 21 years of life, but you can learn a lot more about your life just by revisiting the same memory thousands of times. You learn to see things in more than just your perspective, in ways much more than the words said. It took me 160 years to finally snap. I dont know what came over me, but I wanted to leave this place. I wanted to go to hell. Anything would be better than here. This is when everything around me started to fall apart. It started with me walking up to the bodies of light we called the angels. I tried talking to them, but they never responded back to a word I said. When I truly became desperate, I tried to attack them in any way possible, but anything I struck them with would just go through them. With every attempt, they just looked at them and said the same thing. Keep searching. Keep walking. For you will find the answer. Eighty years have gone by since then, and all I have done was failed attempts of attacking other angels as well as asking everyone else if they knew what the answer was. Everything was a failure. I started to give up hope, but I started on the longest journey of my life. I turned around and started running as fast as I could. I would still see the man flip the sign over and tell us what the next day was. It was annoying at times, but it was really the only thing that kept me from going insane. 55 years go by. It is now my 295th year in Heaven, and I started to see the gate I walked through three lifetimes ago. Three years of constant running and I dont feel like Im any closer, but the scenery around me changes. I am now surrounded by body parts and blood lying all around where I run. I came across a couple of heads, and whenever I see each one I stop running and asking them what happened. Each of them said the same exact thing, Dont look for the truth. The truth wont help you. Endure the punishment. It only gets worse from here. I started to get scared. Not just scared for my life. This was far more. I was scared for my soul. The part that will never die. The part that will suffer for all eternity. No matter how bad we were cut up, sliced open, or just cut into dozens of pieces like the people around me now, I would not be able to leave. This was a punishment that will never end. After three years of running and hearing the same thing over and over again, I started to second guess myself, but I needed to know. It was beyond curiosity. I was trying to get out of the eternal suffering I ended up in. Two years later and the start of my 300th year I approached the gates. I walked up to the man that stood in the front of the gate and fell to my knees, a defeated man. He looked at me with the same eyes that were filled with disappointment and sadness before saying, Nathan Cliff. Poor Nathan Cliff. I begged him to let me out. To let me leave, but he simply said back, Learn the truth and you may leave. In between heavy breaths of panic, I replied back, They told me you would tell me the truth. Or that I would find the truth on my way here. He simply said back, You know the truth. I said the first thing in my mind Is this Hell? He chuckled and said, No. You are in Heaven, but what makes you think Heaven is for the good? You left the paradise created by God. The paradise ruined by us. We can blame the devil all we want, but we are the ones that continue to do wrong. Do you think Lucifer continues to spread his lies to the people when the lies are spread for him? I wanted to argue with him, but deep down I knew that was the truth. Humans are truly what ruined the world God made us. Lucifer may have tempted us, but we are the ones that truly ruined it. I woke back up and saw the woman that was talking to me before I lived through the scariest experience of my life. She calmly said, Dont worry. Youre back now. Dont go on us. Were almost there. I knew she was mostly saying it for herself, but I gave her my best attempt of a nod. She put the defibrillator back down and we were silent for the rest of the ride. Im in the hospital now. I learned that I was dead for 45 seconds. 45 seconds that created exactly 300 years for me. Im on my phone now. The doctors are done treating me. Pain is still erupting all over my body, but man does it feel good. I have a tray of food in front of me. Carrot sticks that I never liked, but it is bursting with flavor for me. Water that is quenching my parched throat, and after I post this experience to you guys I am going to enjoy a [good nights rest.] ( <URL>)","I tried to blame everyone around me, but I knew, deep down, that it was my own fault.",479,6,1

I left for now. I didn't realise that my boyfriend - who lives so far away from me - would actually take me in. It never crossed my mind because of the distance and because I didn't want to impose myself on him and his family. I thought that I had no one at all, but apparently his family had offered to take me in a while ago. I told him I was having issues and he said that I can come live with him, his sister and his parents, and he helped me pack and leave. We'll be back later in the week for the rest of my stuff. When he came to see me, he saw how abusive my sisters were becoming when one of them decided to smash my door down and destroy the fifth lock I had to install, because they wouldn't stop breaking them. She started shouting some particularly nasty things at me and also tried to get him to break up with me as she was putting me down. I just had a complete breakdown. He also took me to see a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with depression and they suspect borderline personality disorder, which is apparently due to my abusive childhood eventually leaving me unable to cope with stress in a productive way. I'm being prescribed mood stabilisers. It's sad when you realise that your family has never loved you. They just said I was running away from my responsibilities and said they'd sell the animals when I'm gone. I'm at least planning to get the rabbits this week. They were the only ones who'd comfort me when I sat downstairs alone at night crying to myself. They'd always come and sit next to me when I was like that. I feel a mix of anger and sadness and I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm struggling to see a future right now, but I plan on just putting together a portfolio and seeing whether or not I can get into an art foundation or games design course with it. I'll also be getting a job when I'm in a better place so that I can start paying rent to this wonderful family who've taken me in, with the hopes of eventually finding my own place. *TL;DR I left that house.

s_2606_508,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"No problems at all. I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself. It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner. I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :) What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say ""nobody's perfect"" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them. I know that was long winded but I hope it helps.","Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself.",1246,6,1

I'm weird and socially inept and I can just feel that my classmates are uncomfortable around me. I don't really like my classmates So, she and I are both very quiet. She often sits alone and I sit alone too. I would want to have conversations with her, but in reality I never talk to her. Not before class, not during class, not after class. I don't talk to her because 1. I'm scared and unconfident 2. I feel like she wants to be left alone since she always sits alone 3. I'm probably gonna mess up anyways because im ugly and socially inept and weird 4. I don't know if she is taken or single, how can I find out? I do not want to immediately date her, I only want to get to know her but I don't know how. If I suddenly start sitting next to her during classes and talking to her, she might get uncomfortable and not want it, I don't know if this is even an appropriate thing to do and probably my whole class will think i'm a creep since normally I don't talk to anyone in the class, so if I suddenly start being social but only with this one girl, its gonna give weird signs to my classmates? I feel so hopeless about this situation. How can I find out if she is single? How can I talk / get to know her without anyone thinking I'm a weirdo since I normally dont talk to anyone? How can I make sure she is not uncomfortable if I talk to her, or sit next to her? How can I get to know her without getting friendzoned? I have no idea how flirting works and even if I learned the theory of it I would be super bad at it due to my autism and bad social skills. Basically how can I work towards making my intentions clear? How can I find out if she likes me? I'm very bad at picking up body language.","I'm always too tired, I have no energy for socializing 3.",679,5,1

In my own experience, my own world I have that I call it my waves but its not waves of happiness and sadness. Im constantly sad. But there are weeks where I literally cant care for myself, I wont care so much to shower, I wont eat I wont do anything at all except think of dying but other weeks.. I walk around pretty numb from all the sadness, I just kind of survive. But the sadness is constant.. there are just different levels I guess for me. That may sound weird, or may not make sense..

I have been unable to enjoy anything in life. The first 2 years of my depression were fine, I was still a motivated, hardworking student. But now that I'm still unable to enjoy anything, I'm growing tired of life. What's the point in working hard if you never enjoy anything in life anyway? My productivity has been going downhill and I might not make it this year in university. I crave to enjoy something, which is why I get distracted off working hard.",I have been unable to enjoy anything in life.,120,1,1
