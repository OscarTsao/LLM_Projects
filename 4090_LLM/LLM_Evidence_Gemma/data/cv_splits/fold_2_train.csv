s_1270_9,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Im not sleeping and my stomach hurts I recently diagnosed myself with adhd, c-ptsd and possibly ASD with extreme executive dysfunction. Ever since running away from insane abusive parents, I was living alone, and I wasnt even able to feed myself on my own. If not for deliveries, I would be long dead. I hate delivery food so much. This has been going on for two years, and my health became worse. I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move. Eventually I was able to stall everything. My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights. For the past week my stomach has been very bad. I guess that skipping breakfast for two years does have consequences. I had two months when I was able to fix my sleep, but now I cant fall asleep until sunrise again. Every new panic attack is more suicidal that previous. I so many plans for many human lifetimes and I dont want to die, but Im suffering way too much. Much more that a human body was made to withstand. Funny enough my adhd so far has prevented me from focusing on self harm, but it doesnt last forever.","I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move.",398,3,1

Recently I gave up dairy products and now very frequently sleep straight through 6-8 hours a night. There was a time when I was getting 6 hours sleep per week. A small caveat to that it I recently switched to 50mg of Trazadone as well, but if I eat even two eggs during the day I won't sleep at night. I am still trying to work out why I didn't try it before but I currently think that there really were no indicators of allergy or intolerance. Then again, maybe I am just trying to persuade myself that I am not totally stupid! I am bloody glad that the sleepless nights are over though. Good luck to those who are still working on it.

Most advices don't work for me. Trust me, I have had so many advices, I tried so much. Doesnt work for me. So read everything before posting I'm a 21 year old guy, still studying, 1,85 / 6'0 tall, average looking, bad social skills. I'm not specifically looking for introvert women, but I do have a problem with overly extravert women. Like, those who talk to strangers for no more reason than ""small talk"". I dont know why, it just annoys me alot. Can't be my girlfriend I prefer the quiet ones. 6 reasons why I can't get a girlfriend or even a date or a female friend 1. the combination of being introvert and having ASD and being a weirdo, has made my social skills horrible. Because of my ASD I can never be socially skilled as normal people. It will never be natural to me even if I practise so much. I think women can always smell that something is different about me and that I'm not condifent in socially challenging situations. Online dating doesn't work for me. I'm not ugly but I guess I'm not attractive enough for women. I don't get swiped right on. And if I rarely get a match, I end up being ghosted although I never send any creepy or needy or sexual messages. I do have conversations with women, but 90% of the time a woman I meet is not what I'm looking for, so there it ends. Even in places of my interests. When I have conversations with women, that is always in places where we are both part of the same group of people. And 10% of them women who I like, even if its only a little bit (I'm open minded and not picky so thats not the problem) I have no idea how to take the next step in asking her out privately. I mean to meet when the group does not. I have never had a date and I have no idea where, when and how to ask a woman out for a date. I have no idea in which places and times it is appropriate or not to ask a woman out. + my social skills will mess it up if I even try to ask a woman out. Because of my depression (yes I really got diagnosed) I have less interest in everything. I have no real hobbies. I spend my days gaming and browsing the internet. I'm very open minded to go outside and do fun things together with a woman, but as long as I'm alone I really have nothing to do outside. You can say I'm a pretty boring person. Trust me, I tried different hobbies, it's just not for me. I'm not interested in anything. I can't enjoy anything in life. I tried, really. I'm willing to go outside and try hobbies with a woman but the problem is that right now I have not much to talk about on dating apps and maybe on a first date. I strongly prefer introverted women because 1. they are my type and 2. their social skills will probably not be good enough to smell that i'm not confident and socially skilled. Problem is that I have no idea where to find introverted women. Every time I go out, I only meet women who are overly extraverted and obviously not my type. They are too different from me. I know that introvert women are probably at home as much as I am, so I don't know how to get in contact with them... Yeah online dating, but those shitty apps like tinder have proven to not work at all for me. Not at all. So what have I tried and what am I still trying? I tried about 10 different dating apps and they all gave me no dates. I decided to stop wasting my time on these dati- ehh i mean swiping apps. Yeah because all I can do there is swiping. Not dating. I'm still trying to be social and make friends but my social skills mess it up every time. I tried improving my social skills for many years already but being social will never be natural and easy for me. I go outside, I meet with strangers, I talk with them, I approach women if they look even the slightest attractive, I just don't know how to go from a conversation to having her number or asking her on a date outside of the place where I met her. I also don't know what to talk about since I don't really have hobbies. The problem is not that I have no hobbies, because Im willing to try any hobbies for a girl. Its just that I dont know what to talk about. Dating apps will not work for me. I get 0 likes, 0 matches and if i get one I will be ghosted soon. My social circle, my friends, no. There are no nice women of my age in my social circle. University, I don't like anyone in my class, so I will HAVE TO approach strangers.

s_2338_920,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"[Rant] Grocery store parking lots I just need to get this off my chest because I can't stop crying. I almost hit a family today with my car, pregnant mother included. I was waiting to back out, letting cars pass me in my tiny Prius C, struggling to look around the big truck parked next to me. Finally a break in the cars passing, so I start to back out slowly. Then I see a woman to my right looking terrified, so I stop and look around me and I see a man yelling at me. I shrug, say ""I'm so sorry!"", look around me once more and keep backing up. More yelling as I see a 30 week pregnant woman rushing to walk out of the way as I start to back out again. Turns out she was in my huuuge blind spot (the corner of my car). I start crying, yell ""I'm so sorry"" and finally back out and drive away. Now I can't stop crying. I can't be for sure I didn't tap someone with my car because I didn't get out and ask like I should have. I'm trying to reassure myself that there wasn't frantic screaming as I was trying to pull away, just me getting the finger from the man and yelled at. I also didn't feel anything as I was backing out. Now I'm going to live in constant fear for the upcoming weeks that the police are going to show up at my door and haul me away. Fuck my car's blind spot, fuck my apparently not thorough checking all my mirrors and windows. At least for once I'm not trying to blame the family, though it did cross my mind for a second. **EDIT** Thank you all SO MUCH. I feel so much better. Went and got my hair cut and have completely calmed down. DH is even taking me out to dinner to help me feel better too. Thanks for your kind words and support :)",Now I can't stop crying.,795,0,1

s_1673_863,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"I rolled over on to my right side, seeking optimal comfort under the oppressive softness and warmth of my heavy comforter. Letting out a sigh of content I curled up tighter, trying to squeeze every bit of warmth from this unforgiving room. Winter nights have always been the worst in this house. The draft that permeated the upper floors was almost unbearable at times, prompting the purchase of the extra thick bedsheets. One would think that there must be some sort of problem with the top floor, perhaps a lack of insulation, or improperly laid venting. The problem here is that I've had the house inspected several times by various different people. From furnace and duct work specialists to general contractors and so far no one has found anything of note. It was frustrating to say the least but luckily everything else about the house is great. I should probably just invest in a space heater and stop complaining to be honest. As the thoughts of of my house slowly wound down into peaceful nothingness, the hands of the sandman carefully wrapped around me, dragging me ever more quickly into his realm of slumber. Biology seemed to have a different idea though, and with my consciousness waning my bladder made a desperate plea. "" Seriously?"" I thought to myself ""Always at the worst times, I swear"". I grumbled audibly as I tentatively removed myself from my wonderful cocoon and stepped into the frigid landscape that was my bedroom. I grabbed a sweater that hung from the door and slipped it on, already shivering in the pale moonlight. Glancing at my alarm told me it was 12:26 am. I had been tossing and turning for nearly 2 hours. I've suffered from mild insomnia for years, so this wasn't anything new to me. However it didn't make it any more easy to leave my thermal sanctuary. As if sensing what I was doing my bladder let out an even more desperate cry, forcing me to nearly duck waddle as I made my way down the dark hallway to the bathroom. I flicked the light switch on, blinding myself in the process. Through squinted eyes I was able to make out the toilet and begin my business. My eyes had adjusted by the time I was finished, so I took a moment to inspect my face in the mirror as I washed my hands. My eye's were those of a man who was far too tired and cold, nearly dead in their stare. If I they weren't mine I'd probably be scared of eyes like this. I took a second to inspect the thin scar that ran across the bridge of my nose, a remnant of my childhood. I had apparently done battle with a coffee table when I was 5 and the coffee table won. "" I got a cool scar out of it at least"" I thought to myself. I finished my hands and flushed the toilet. This is my least favorite part of late night wanderings. I stood in the doorway, took a deep breath and turned off the bathroom light. Now I'm not a superstitious person, I'm not paranoid, I'm not one to jump at shadows. For some reason though, standing in total darkness waiting for my eyes to adjust, has always terrified me, even in my own home. When i was younger It was a real problem. I'd never go to the bathroom at night unless i absolutely had to, to the point where wetting the bed was a more preferred outcome. As I became older it did get better but even now at 23 i still get freaked out about late night lavatory visits. They say that the fear of the dark is simply the fear of the unknown and i believe that holds true. I'd imagine it's a primeval thing, dating back to when a shadow in the dark was likely a predator trying to eat you. The lack of predators in the urban sprawl doesn't comfort me though. When my eyes finally came into focus I started to make my retreat towards my downy fortress. My eyes deceived me though and i managed to stub my pinky toe, on the unseen door to the laundry room, which had been left slightly open. The pain was bad but i was too tired to do anything but grumble and shuffle back to my room. Slipping the sweater off, I crawled back into bed. I was beginning to drift off again when i heard it. A single muffled bump. Normally this wouldn't have really bothered me but I was already on edge from my recent expedition. I decided It was probably nothing until I heard another one a minute or so later. It was strange but likely just an animal on the roof. But it continued and my sleep deprived mind went to thoughts of Jeremy. This is what got me out of bed. Slowly standing up, I donned my sweater once more and stepped into the dim hallway for a second time. I made my way slowly down the hall, my eyes already keen in the darkness. I didn't want to turn on any lights lest I lose what night vision I had. I made it to the bathroom and listened. I heard the bump again, it definitely wasn't on the roof like I had previously thought. It seemed to be coming from downstairs. My stomach jumped into my chest. I lost all sense of self preservation and ran downstairs not caring who was listening. I made it to the second door on the left and swung it open, flicking on the light as i did so. What greeted me was extremely relieving. "" What are you doing Jeremy? Whats the matter?"" My son looked at me, a rather terrified and confused look on his face and then he ran over and hugged my leg. I picked him up, and held him tightly as he tried his best to explain what was wrong. He was a decent speaker for 3 but he seemed to be trying to say a couple different things at once. I calmed him down and eventually found out that he had heard a monster making noise upstairs. He said he didn't want to go up there so he tried banging on his wall to get attention. I smiled at that, which prompted and even more quizzical look from my son. "" Don't worry I was just up there, and If there were any monsters they must have run away scared"". Jeremy seemed relieved at that, but still seemed a bit shaken up. "" Do you want to sleep in our bed tonight?"" I asked , i got a small nod in answer. I carried him upstairs, showing him the lack of monsters firsthand, which calmed him down immensely. By the time i laid him in between my wife and I, he was already sound asleep. My wife rolled over a gave me a look, to which i responded ""Don't worry about it, just dealing with some monsters"". I climbed into bed pecked my wife and son on the cheek and drifted off.","I've suffered from mild insomnia for years, so this wasn't anything new to me.",1645,3,1

Mentally, I was very ill , weak, with low blood pressure , low iron and developing psychosis. I dormed at the time and began thinking my roommates were stealing my food; I had terrible bouts of mood swings and violent outbursts . I began isolating myself from everyone- didnt want to be seen and my mom would cry the few times a year shed see me. It was a hell hole when I look back . I had no friends for 8 years thanks to starving myself like 0 people to hang out with or talk to. Anyways, as the years rolled by, my health just continued to decline. Fears grew that I was developing lupus , early arthritis, I contracted stomach ulcers and alopecia from restricting and idk, just one day last year, I had a nervous breakdown which lasted about 2 months. I saw my life for what it really was and absolutely hated myself for torturing myself the way I did. I realized it was sick for a 26 year old to still wear kids clothes. My ED stopped making sense to me; it stopped making me happy and I understood I was going to die at an early age if I continued on. So last year I began my recovery and had a huge relapse because I didnt up my intake enough to reach extreme hunger but Ive been back on track since May, began taking Abilify which lessened my obsessive thoughts, went up by a Jean size and am close but not too close to being weight restored .

s_2890_305,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Not Your Average Sibling Rivalry I think when you're a twin you hear a lot more about this supposed twin telepathy. Not because it actually happens to you though, but because everyone *asks* if it does. Well, I don't think it did. As many times as we were pestered by other kids wondering if we knew each other's thoughts, we really never did. Well not more than the average person could know anyways. My name is Ashe, and my twin sister is named Willow. Not wanting to be part of the trend of rhyming names, or names with the same first letter, our parents decided we should be trees. They definitely aren't the worst names we could have ended up with, I've heard rumors that our grandmother suggested to name us Beverly and Bailey. I think I'd die of embarrassment if I had to deal with my family calling me Bev all the time. It just seems like a *mom* name, you know? Anyways, that's besides the point here. Willow and I were always kind of competitive with each other, even though I seemed to always be on the losing end. Actually, it's not even that *I* was competitive with her, it was that I wasn't allowed to be good at anything unless she could be too. She had to be better. She wanted all of the attention. I played soccer? She played it better. I got excellent grades? She'd take my work and either copy it, or pass it off as her own. There was no getting ahead of her. Sure, I knew I was slightly smarter than her, but being in the same classes didn't help. Her being everyone's favorite didn't help either. I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself. Everyone overlooked me. We may have looked identical, but everyone could tell the difference. Being better at everything made Willow stand out next to me. When we were sixteen things changed for a short time. We went to a party together, and that night I think I realized that my twin sister was truly *evil.* More than just sibling rivalry, she had to hate me. It hasn't been long enough for me to be entirely comfortable talking about the whole situation, but I'll do what I can. We were going to a party together, the kind you have to sneak out of your window while your parents sleep to attend. For once my sister wanted me to outshine her. She helped me get dressed, and put on my makeup. She made me look beautiful, while she dressed casually. It's like we had switched places in the mirror. I think that's what she wanted. We snuck out just after 11, a friends car was waiting by the road to take us a few streets over for the party. When we got there Willows ex kept pestering us. He stalked us around the party, and while Willow left me to go talk to other people, he somehow became convinced that I was her. At this point I was a few too many drinks in, and I thought it would be funny to play along. I kissed him, and by the time we ended up in a room alone I realized that I had made a mistake. I tried again to tell him that I really wasn't her, but he told me he didn't care anymore. It was enough that I looked like her. Things went downhill from there, and when I saw Willow peek her head into the room, I thought she had come to save me. She didn't though, she watched it all happen, and snuck away before he left me there broken. It fucked me up. I didn't know who to tell, my sister watched it all happen and never told a soul, so I did the same. I kept it quiet, I started writing my feelings in a journal, and I became incredibly depressed. It got to the point where my parents actually became concerned, and they took me to a therapist. Though I wasn't ready to discuss what happened the therapist seemed to help somewhat, it gave me an unbiased person to talk to. With my parents so concerned for me, I was actually getting more attention than Willow for once. It didn't last long. Within a month things went downhill. Willow seemed to decide that if I got to be depressed, then so did she. She stole my journal, told our parents that it was hers, and they panicked. They couldn't have their favorite daughter turning into the sad little thing I had become. She stole my tragedy, openly talked about what her ex had done to *her.* I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone the truth, I still wasn't ready to admit what he did to me. She didn't hold back though, and things only became worse. She started lying about me, she told everyone that I saw it happen and did nothing to help. The entire world was against me, and my parents pulled me out of therapy. They decided that my sadness was actually guilt over not helping my sister, and I didn't deserve to feel better. Life became hell, there was no escape. I got a new journal, I sunk deeper into my feelings, I started mutilating myself just so that I would feel something that wasn't *sadness.* No one cared at all. Though I had lived my entire life in my sister's shadow, this was worse. I was a pariah. Nothing I did couldn't somehow be turned against me. Being upset wasn't okay, none of my problems existed, I was branded the liar who was trying to steal Willows problems. They found out I was hurting myself, it must have been because Willow was doing it. Everything I did *had* to be because of her. Everyone believed that I was the one trying to steal her life, her pain. I couldn't be my own person. This went on until after we turned 18. The school year was almost over, it was all almost over. I'd be able to leave, finally be free. I could make my own life, I could finally be my own person. I couldn't handle the past though, I needed to do something so that I wouldn't be followed by it. I could only think of one option, I plotted out how I would do it for weeks. It took me awhile to get the courage, but I was going to kill myself. My entire existence mattered to no one, everyone was disgusted by what Willow had convinced them to think about me. When our parents found the body, they also found the journal. The journal with *Ashe* written across the front. It didn't contain much, just apologies and the details of a planned suicide. They seemed devastated, but at the same time relieved. Their shameful daughter had done the world a favor. They held me while I cried, everything would be different now. They never believed in all the issues that Ashe had, they never understood that her pain had been stolen and used against her. They would never know. I never wanted my sister's life, I wanted my own life. Now I'm the only one around to live for both of us. She took my life in spite, but she didn't realize how much of me she took by stealing my death. My name was Ashe, but my sister stole that last part of me when she collapsed on the bathroom floor holding my journal. I finally have my life back, everyone knows what happened to me. Everyone knows how hard my life was, and saw the pain I suffered through. Now everyone calls me Willow. [HF](<URL>)","I wasn't exactly jealous, but I felt constantly disappointed in myself.",1520,6,1

s_2890_89,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"This Job Has Given Me More Than Just Money *Where do you see yourself in five years?* Happy maybe, or dead. It's a question I've been asked a lot, and I have never been quite sure how to answer it. There are things I *want* to do, there is so much of life I haven't experienced. Yet I couldn't pinpoint what to do. Often enough I feel entirely at a loss for what to do with myself, I mean, what's the point? Here I am at 19, working in perhaps the strangest and most secretive hotel ever to exist, because I really needed for there to be a point. I needed a way out of the life I'd found myself stuck in. Four years ago was when an abusive man made me realize my only option. I had to run. I had a friend who I'd known since elementary school who was several years older than me, lived in the U.S, and was already engaged with a baby on the way. They were just scraping by themselves since they were both barely 20, but they knew the extent of what I was living with and offered me a hideaway. It was the end of my freshman year of highschool, and I told my father about plans to *visit* some friends over the summer. He seemed to be fine with having me gone, but the weeks leading up to my departure were some of the worst. I used all the money I had left from babysitting to buy a bus ticket-- which was a small sum, since that's what happens when your father borrows your money for beer-- and packed my bags days before I was set to leave. The morning of my trip my father woke me up at 6am. I had to be out of the house and in the car within five minutes if I wanted to leave, he was not in a good mood. We drove at 90(Km) on a street that I believe was 30. I think we hit 140 on the highway. By 6:30 we were at the truck stop where the bus would be picking me up. Usually a 45 minute drive at the least. When I got out of the car, he peeled out of the parking lot, causing bystanders to stare. It was nearly four hours til my bus would arrive, I had no spare money to buy food from the truck stop, nor any food with me, and I sat at a picnic bench outside and waited with my single suitcase for hours. Thankfully my phone was working, and I spent the time texting my friends to tell them I'd see them in a few weeks. Those texts changed into goodbyes later when I was across the border and safe. I got on the bus and travelled to the biggest city in the country, where I met with my friend, Emily. She was a dual citizen, and planned to drive me from this city to her house. We got in the car and drove, stopping at the border to identify ourselves. Being under 16 I didn't need a passport to cross, but a birth certificate. They also asked if I had permission from my parents, since my friend was obviously not old enough to be my guardian. I actually had managed to get my father to drunkenly sign a note I'd typed up to give myself permission to go for a few weeks; He assumed it was a school form and didn't read it. We got across and back to Emilys house in a few hours of relative peace. I was finally in a place where my father couldn't follow due to his criminal past. Money was often tight, I couldn't work because I had no social security, and no one would pay me under the table within a reasonable distance. I had no car or license, and couldn't get one. Emily attended a local community college and her fiance worked, but it was just barely enough to cover the bills and cost of her classes. The process of becoming a citizen took awhile for her, she was lucky that she came here when she was older and had a better paying job before coming. Emily had a nice chunk in her savings by the time she crossed over, and it still took her over a year to become a citizen. I've been here for nearly five years now, I'll be twenty pretty soon. We've hardly got anything saved towards paying for my citizenship, and I constantly feel guilty that I can't help get things moving. Since I've been here they had their first baby, and now Emily is pregnant with their third. Since both of them are still trying to lead normal lives, I've been helping to take care of their kids and the house. Emily has managed to continue to go to school, though taking certain semesters off to care for her kids has definitely slowed down the already long process of nursing school. Her fiance, Jeremy, has been working a steady job all this time. It pays well, but with a growing family things can be pretty rough at times. I finished out high school here, because schools can't decline you based on citizenship apparently. I have a high school diploma, from an American school. That helped me not feel so useless for my first couple of years here, but since money is too tight for me to attend college as well I've been doing a lot of nothing for nearly two years. I just help around the house, spend time with Emily and Jeremy, and help with the kids. I've always wished I could do more. That's why yesterday when I got a text from a number in the same area code as me, that said there was a way that I could earn money without needing a social security number, I was more excited than wary. I assumed it was a friend who I had given my number to on Facebook while discussing my job search, and didn't bother asking who I was talking to. I figured I could do just about any job that would help towards becoming a citizen, finally attending college, and becoming someone real within the world. They ended up sending me an email to contact. I didn't hesitate to send in an email containing my nearly empty resume. I received a reply within minutes, asking me to detail my current financial situation and my reasoning for wanting the job. I explained how I had been told that I could be hired here without a Social Security number, and how I couldn't find anywhere else that would do so. I also told him why I needed the money, and vaguely described my living situation. He seemed very kind in his reply, letting me know that he could have someone pick me up to bring me in for a final interview, after I filled out their application form. I quickly filled out the form that was sent to me, slightly confused by some of the questions it contained. He gave another hasty reply, seeming pleased with my application he offered to have an employee come pick me up at three that afternoon to have our final interview by 5pm. He gave me some details of the job they wanted me for, and I was pleased that it seemed to be simple work. $40 an hour to do housekeeping for a hotel. $10 from my pay would be taken each week for the cost of having someone from the hotel driving me to and from work. All further details would be discussed during the interview. Emily arrived home at two, and I excitedly told her about the job offering. One of the emails told me that I should not reveal the name of the hotel that was hiring me to anyone, because they didn't want it being known that they would pay under the table. I told Emily this, and she didn't pester to know the exact details of my employment. At 3:10pm a truck pulled up in front of the house, a good choice to fit into the middle-of-nowhere area we lived. I told Emily I'd see her later in the evening, and set outside to introduce myself to the stranger in the car. I've never been the outgoing type, but I've been told that I'm always a really friendly person. I don't have many friends, but I've met many people and all of those first impressions seem to have gone well. The driver introduced himself as Tyler, an employee at the hotel, and he apologized for being late. He explained that he didn't drive a lot for the hotel, and he'd never picked up a passenger like me. He didn't ask me many questions, and didn't seem to be aware of the reason he was picking me up. Will you be driving me everyday? I asked him to break to silence of the drive. Everyday? He questioned back. For work? I'm going in for an interview, I told him. Ohhh, the word was dragged out, as though it was dispelling whatever other reason he had thought he was escorting me to the hotel, If we're on the same shift probably, your house is on the way from mine. I debated asking him what the he initially thought he was escorting me for, but instead I let the car fall into another moment of silence. I've never been the best at keeping a conversation going, but his voice soon filled the vehicle again. If you get the job, I can tell you it's an experience like no other. I can't tell you much, since you're not an employee yet, but Mister Smith will go over all the details with you, I'm sure, he paused to smile at me for a moment, Any idea what position you'll be working? Housekeeping, I replied distractedly, wondering about what sort of hotel this could be to provide experiences worth talking about, while being unable to talk about them. Ugh, he made a face of exaggerated displeasure, Better you than me, I couldn't clean up after strangers. I'd find it tedious. I shrugged, It's pretty much all I'm good at. His face was in an expression of apology when he glanced at me, I didn't mean anything bad by that, it's valid work. I smiled at him, not wanting him to worry over a comment that I honestly hadn't taken any offence with, I know, I was just saying. That's why it's a great job for me. He seemed relieved that he hadn't come off as rude, and we spent the rest of the ride cycling in between small talk and silence. It was pleasant, I felt comfortable and relatively confident about the job. Meaning that I didn't really feel confident whatsoever, but I'd choke those feelings down and attempt not to let my nervousness shine through during the interview. Tyler pulled up in front of the hotel, and I was astounded that such grandeur could exist in the heavily wooded area. The forest that surrounded must have been ancient, because the trees that filled it were taller than I could have ever imagined any trees to be. Somehow the hotel looked natural among the towering foliage, as though it was meant to be in this place. It was beautiful and remote, a perfect getaway. I felt at peace as I got out of the car, *almost* enough to ease my nerves over the rapidly incoming interview. Tyler directed me to head into the lobby and speak to someone at the front desk while he parked the truck with the other hotel vehicles. I entered the hotel to find a lobby as immaculate as the exterior, the hotel was truly extravagant, and I could almost understand why the application featured such odd personal questions. It brought the large paycheck into perspective as well, and defeated any wariness that may have been held deep within me. There was a girl with long, raven-colored hair, and shocking blue eyes who stood behind the front desk. Welcome to the Good Shade, I'm Dawn, how can I help you? She greeted cheerfully as I arrived at the desk. I squinted for a moment at her name tag, which quite obviously did not say Dawn. That was the only opportunity I've had so far to look at her name tag, but if I recall correctly it said *Alphaea I.C*. I'm not sure what that means, but it didn't really look like a name to me, so I dismissed it as some sort of labelling the hotel has for staff. I returned her smile, I'm here to see Mister Smith about a position here. She gasped excitedly, I knew you'd be here soon, right this way, he's waiting for you. With a glee filled smile she gestured to a door behind the front desk. I wasn't sure what she was so excited about, but as I walked towards the door I could swear that she *sniffed* me. I found myself slightly concerned about the mental health of the girl at the front desk, and wondered vaguely if people like her were the reason that the application contained such odd questions. A tall man sat behind a dark wood desk, and introduced himself as Mister Smith. He was the owner and manager of the hotel. He created all the rules and guidelines for the staff and guests, and he oversaw all that went on inside the hotel. He also personally dealt with all applications for employment, which apparently didn't happen often. Before any conversation about the position took place, I had to sign an agreement to keep everything confidential. Honestly, I wouldn't even know that posting here was an option if I hadn't seen [Tyler's post](<URL>) on here a while back. I've been reading the awful tales of the darkest moments in the lives of people for many years, but I never thought I'd be one of the people posting. That's besides the point though, I have to finish detailing what I experienced last night. After signing the form we began discussing the job. I'd be doing regular hotel housekeeping-- for the most part. My job would not always be a regular one, there was the possibility of my assistance being needed with guests, or I may end up requested by a guest for certain actions. I was fine with all of that. Some of the actions detailed deep within the contract seemed odd, but it was all well within what was worth it for the job and the money. This was the only job I could get, and it honestly didn't seem like a bad one. We arranged to have 30% of my pay deposited directly into Jeremy's account, after a quick phone call with him to confirm this was acceptable. That portion would be what I used to pay back Emily and Jeremy for housing me for free over the years. 60% would be deposited into a savings account that the hotel had provided me with. Another contract had to be signed there, but all Mister Smith did was make a phone call in private afterwards. The final ten percent would be put into a chequing account that came with the savings. That was the money I planned to spend freely, whether I used it to buy clothes, groceries, or help out with the bills when things were tight at home. My savings would first be going towards citizenship, then getting a cheap place for myself. I plan to stop being a burden on my friends as soon as I can, they have a growing family and shouldn't also have to deal with a nearly 20 year old woman living off of them. Once the apartment was in place and I had enough in my savings, I'd be able to work towards college. Living on my own would have me spending a portion of my cheque on rent, but if I manage to keep this job that won't be an issue. This job paid more than well enough for me to finally get myself out into the world. I suppose that I should have been concerned when he asked me to confirm my genetic background. When I replied that I was fairly certain that I was 100% human, he seemed skeptical. He squinted at me for a moment, and it made me nervous. * Why on Earth would you question whether I'm human or not?* Then things got really strange, he asked me if I would mind consenting to a blood test. I agreed, but it definitely freaked me out. I kept reminding myself that this was my only option. By the end of the meeting I had agreed to the requirements of the job, had my blood taken, and signed what may have been dozens of forms. I also found out that my first shift had already begun, and I would be spending my night at the hotel. I called Emily from the phone in the office to let her know that I wouldn't be returning until morning. I was about to leave the office when the girl from the front desk entered the room. She held out a plastic card to me, and I was shocked when I realized what it was. A debit card from a bank local to my area, it had my name on it and looked exactly like Emily's card from the same bank. Mister Smith assured me that this was a fully functional card, and that he had pulled some strings with a friend at the bank to create an account for me. As long as I was employed with the hotel they would be sure that I would face no consequences from possessing an American account before becoming a citizen, and Mister Smith would be glad to have his friend add my social security information once I become a citizen, so creating a new account and transferring the money would not be necessary in the future. I was beyond grateful as I left the office, for the job, the bank account, and the understanding that my boss seemed to express over my confusing situation. I was told to speak to Dawn so that she could give me the items I'd need to begin my shift. When I was once again facing the front desk, both Dawn and Tyler stood behind it smiling. Did you get the job? Tyler asked me. I smiled, I did actually, Mister Smith told me I needed to speak to Dawn before I get to work. That's great-- He stopped short to stare intently at the computer screen in front of him for a brief moment, --Sorry, I've been requested to a room. Are you coming, Dawn? She shook her head, I have to help our new friend meet with Rose, but-- she squinted at the screen for a moment, -- It's just my stupid brother, you'll be fine, she rolled her eyes as she stepped away from the counter. Tyler shrugged and walked off towards several sets of elevators, and I watched as he produced a key card and swiped it through a card reader before pressing the call button. As he got into the elevator I looked back to Dawn, who was pulling a piece of paper from a filing cabinet, then she walked back towards me. Read this, let me know if you have any questions, she stated simply. I took the paper and looked it over, some of it brought my concern back into full force. *Welcome to housekeeping at the Good Shade,*
*Your position is a key role in our hotel, as we are well known for how immaculately kept such a large establishment remains constantly. On request you may be provided with a brief map of the property, which explains some of the regulations about guests located in different areas of the hotel.* *Certain rooms require specific towels, sheets, blankets, soaps, etcetera. Please refer to the head of our housekeeping crew for a list of rooms and their requirements.* *At this point, you have already signed various contracts restricting you from speaking about any aspect of your job. This was included in the documents you signed, but we must reiterate that in the case of finding items that you consider to be suspicious, dangerous, illegal, evidence in a crime, or remnants of a crime, you are not to react as you would in a normal situation.* *Emergency services are unable to be contacted from or enter our establishment. We have medical staff who can deal with any wounded person(s) found in a room. We also have teams to deal with any person(s) found who may be deceased. Please refrain from touching any person(s), whether they be living or deceased. This also includes any other guests, and generally the other employees.* *If accidental contact is made at any point, please refer to the front desk for treatment of any negative side effects. Other than the items above, housekeeping here is relatively the same as everywhere else. Please remember that we take pride in immaculately clean rooms. Please refer to the head of housekeeping for concerns about anything found while working, and further details about the job.* *- A. Smith, Owner Manager*
I think it's hardly a question that anyone who read such a thing would be fairly concerned about what kind of hotel this truly was. I need the money though, and on the bright side, at least if I find a dead body I don't have to be the one to remove it. After reviewing that sentence, I realize that my life may have hit it's utter low. Once I get enough money though, I could put this all behind me. I have a chance to quit in three months according to the contract, and there were consequences that I didn't want to learn about for quitting before you had worked the allotted time. This place seems to be incredibly serious about the whole secrecy thing, and I think this subreddit might be part of the reason that the employees can handle holding it in around the rest of the world. I didn't bother asking Dawn any questions at that moment, I just steeled myself for the night ahead of me. She pulled out a key card and handed it to me with a smile. Head to floor U1, and Rose should be in the laundry room waiting for you. That's the storage floor. The strange label of the floor gave me pause. She smiled as though this was a charmingly innocent question that was often brought up, Mister Smith always forgets to tell the new employees, we actually have 50 underground floors. When we send you to a room with the label U in front of the number, it's underground. I nodded, I honestly had guessed as much when I'd first heard her announce the floor I needed to go to, but it was still a little surprising to know for a fact that this hotel has underground floors. What could have possibly motivated someone to build a hotel that had its majority of rooms below the earth? I thanked Dawn for her assistance, and headed towards the elevators. There was a handwritten message on the back of the housekeeping paper that I hadn't noticed until then, it said *Use the second elevator *
I glanced back towards Dawn and she gave me a small smile and wave, before turning to type something into the computer. I arrived in front of the second elevator, and I swiped the card I held through the reader as I had seen Tyler do. The call button lit up when I pressed it, and the elevator opened before me in less than a minute. I got to the correctly labelled floor and was in the laundry room too fast to calm my nerves about my first shift. There was a woman in there, maybe in her mid twenties. She was beautiful, tall and curvy, with honey-blonde hair spilling down to her waist. She turned to me as I approached, and she gave me a smile that warmed her ice-blue eyes. She straightened as she took in my appearance, and her sudden change in expression made it seem as though she sensed something was amiss. That expression quickly changed back though, and she introduced herself as Rose, the head of housekeeping. For my first night all she wanted me to do was two of the underground floors. Approximately ten rooms on each of those floors had been vacated earlier in the day and needed to be arranged for new guests. Around twenty rooms in one shift didn't sound bad. She told me which rooms needed certain things, and gave me a list that carefully inventoried every item that needed to be present in each room that I cleaned. She also explained to me the hotel protocol for cleaning various things, including blood. After all of the preparation I was finally ready to get to work. It was more than twenty rooms, but I didn't complain. I took a cleaning cart and headed off to the floor below me to begin. That floor consisted of mostly regular housekeeping tasks. I took my time, not wanting to be left with nothing to do halfway through my shift. After nearly three hours I finished 12 rooms on that floor. They were all pretty basic, each room was the same. I moved on to the next floor with around six hours left in the ten hour shift. The first few rooms went simply, I made beds and restocked towels. I vacuumed, swept, mopped, and wiped things down. As I progressed down the hallway I heard strange noises coming from occupied rooms. It ranged from crying, to screaming, to what seemed like some intense sexual activity. From one room I heard what sounded like chanting in a foreign language. All the strange noises put me slightly on edge, and I tried to push through the 15 rooms on the floor that I was assigned to clean. I got to the last room and found blood splatter in the shower, fresh enough to still be pooling in the tub. The sight made me dizzy, and I had to take a moment to catch my breath. It freaked me out, I wasn't sure how fast blood dried but I felt like I had narrowly missed seeing criminal activity. I cleaned out the tub using the methods Rose had described to me, and finished that room faster than any other. Or at least, I thought I did. I walked out into the hallway and noticed a dried smear on the wall that hadn't been there before, assuming it was blood I quickly cleaned it. I wasn't about to get in trouble because a murderous guest was running rampant through the hotel. I was afraid though, what if the person who caused this bloodshed was still nearby? I strode hastily towards the elevator with my cart in tow. I let out a breath that I didn't realize I was holding when I met Rose back in the laundry room. What took you so long? She asked as I put away the cart. I was confused by the question, I still had hours left in my shift. I looked at the clock on the wall and was surprised to see that my shift had ended thirty minutes prior. Somehow I had lost a lot of time. I explained to her what I found while cleaning, but she seemed unconcerned. She dismissed me for the day, and I went up to the lobby to find Tyler. He informed me that his shift didn't end for over an hour, but I could nap in the office on the couch while Mister Smith was gone. I took the offer, and awoke later to have Tyler escort me to the truck we had arrived in. As we got in the vehicle I noticed his nametag, *Tyler Stephens, H.S.*
What does H.S mean? Is that some sort of hotel label? I pointed towards the tag. He glanced at it and smiled, Kind of a hotel thing, they put your species on your nametag to help the guests. I was surprised. H.S is quite obviously homosapien, but what did Dawn's nametag mean? Was I truly working with people who weren't human? I didn't know how to respond with anything more intelligent than, *Oh, okay.* Tyler had just started the engine when I saw Dawn come running from the hotel. She stopped at my window and gestured for me to open it, and once it was down she handed me a small piece of metal. She told me it was my nametag, and I thanked her for delivering it. We drove away, and I found myself staring at the nametag. I wondered if I would fit in as an employee at this hotel. Perhaps most importantly, I'm wondering if the people here can answer a question while I'm employed. A question that Tyler had no clue how to answer on the drive. A question about what their blood test revealed, because I'm not sure why my nametag reads *Isabelle Lawrence, N.F.*
The last thing Tyler said to me before he dropped me off was this, You're going to see a lot of things that you've never expected, imagined, or wanted to see. If you think you've had a weird night already, you haven't seen anything yet. I had trouble going to sleep as the sun rose, I took the time to think about my life. *Where do you see yourself in five years?* How can I know, when I'm not even sure if I'm human anymore? -----

s_1692_755,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Recently Opened Documents How well do you pay attention to your list of recently opened documents? Last night, when tracking down a file I had worked on, I spotted an unfamiliar filename on the list: ryansjournal.docx. Privacy be dammed, I read it. I wish I hadnt. A whole day has gone by, and I still cannot shake the goose bumps: the content wasdisturbing, to say the least. Take a look:
**Entry 1 - July 2nd, 2014:**
*My name is Ryan and Im 11 years old. Im writing this journal for a time capsule Im burying. Hi, older me! Hope you made it as a firefighter!* *Me and mom moved this week. Theres a lot of boxes everywhere. I dont like it here. Its really small. I miss my big backyard with the pool and all the oak trees. I used to climb them and pretend I was king of the forest. There are no trees here. Just a fence and a bit of grass. I dont know anyone here. The worst is that its REALLY creepy at night. The shadows in my room look like theyre about to reach out and grab me. Im too old for a nightlight so I snuck a flashlight under my pillow so mom wont ask questions.* My intention in moving was simple: shorten my commute to work and lower my bills. I was wasting so much money heating up an entire house, when a two-bedroom apartment did the job. The apartment is in the basement, so it requires less AC in the summer and less heating in the winter. As an added bonus, the place is pitch black at night. The master bedroom in my old house overlooked a street lamp. Not even the blackest of curtains could keep the light from shining in and, as a result, I had trouble falling asleep. I sleep like a baby in this apartment. **Entry 2 July 16th, 2014:**
*Mom finished unpacking. She must have forgotten a few boxes, because I dont have any toys to play with. I still dont have any friends because mom wont let me go to the park. She said Ill make new friends when school starts. I think shes just too lazy to show me the way to the park. This sucks! I hate it here! I hate HER! Shes the WORST! I wish I had someone to talk to! I want to go home! Every night, the shadows get closer and closer to my bed and I scare them away with my flashlight. Im afraid the batteries will die.* **Entry 3 July 30th, 2014:**
*Today, I made a new friend!!! His name is Deacon and he lives in my closet behind a super-secret door Im not supposed to tell mom about. Hes really fun. His favorite color is green, just like me! I hope me and Deacon will be friends forever. He likes all the same food as me and plays all the same games! Hes older and a little scary-looking, but I dont mind. He even told me he could protect me from the shadows at night.* **Entry 4 August 13th, 2014:**
*I asked mom if Deacon could have supper with us tonight, but she ignored me. She was on her computer again, looking at weird symbols all evening. I grabbed an extra plate of food after supper and took it to my room for Deacon. He loved the ground beef but didnt touch the peas. I cant blame him. Peas are gross!* I work as a Web Developer at a University, and August is our busiest time of the year. Its not unusual for me to have to do a bit of overtime in the weeks leading up to the start of the Fall semester. I suppose HTML code can look a lot like weird symbols to the untrained eye. I can read HTML like you would read a book. Its like my mind automatically renders the tags into their intended format. I suppose to others, it must be as foreign as sheet music is to me: I do not understand it and all I see are a bunch of dots on a half-dozen lines. **Entry 5 August 27th, 2014:**
*Mom still wont let me invite Deacon for supper, so I have to sneak food to him every night. She keeps telling me Deacon isnt real. She says Im too old to have an imaginary friend. I told her to go suck a turdsicle. She didnt like that. I was sent to my room. I hate her. Deacon is real! Hes my best friend! He even crawls into bed with me at night to protect me from the scary shadows in the room. He holds me so tight that I cant move sometimes. He says as long as were together were safe. I believe him. I see the shadows scurrying away and up the wall whenever he crawls over.* **Entry 6 September 24th, 2014:**
*Sorry I didnt write for a while. I started school and had SO MUCH homework. Mom wont let me on the computer unless Im done. 5th graders get a LOT of homework. By the time Im done, moms on her stupid websites and wont let me have my turn. Why cant we have two computers like a normal family?!!??!?! At least I have Deacon to talk to. Mom doesnt like it when she hears us talk. She says its not healthy to talk to myself. Shes a triple-stupid dumb-shake with a cherry on top! If shed just let him eat with us, shed see hes real.* A crudely drawn [MS Paint doodle](<URL>) was included with this entry. On it, I can make out Ryan with a tall, dark figure looming over him, holding his shoulders. The man has long, claw-like fingers, big dark holes for eyes, and a large gaping smiling mouth with sharp fangs. He seems to be looking at my cat, who is cowering in the corner of the room. **Entry 7 October 8th, 2014:**
*Deacon isnt happy. Mom found his hiding spot. She got rid of all his stuff!!! Hes hiding in the ceiling now. Theres a little crawl space where the air conditioner goes. Hes in there right now. I can hear him grunting. Hes so upset. Mom needs to apologize if she knows whats good for her.* I did find a little door in the walk-in closet. I opened it up and got a face full of dust. There were a few boxes of trinkets, which I assumed belonged to the apartments previous owners. I tossed them out. Who needs old rags, magazines, and worn shoes? I found the small storage space after hearing skittering noises in the walls. I wasnt sure if mice had gotten in, or if the apartment was crackling from the cold outside. I never dreamed I would find the perfect place to store winter apparel. I cleaned it up and filled it with coats and boots. **Entry 8 October 22nd, 2014:**
*Deacon couldnt come and protect me last night because mom left my bedroom door open. He said he doesnt want her to see us together. She might make him go away if she saw him and the shadows. I was so scared. I cried myself to sleep. I needed his big strong arms to protect me. I woke up in the middle of the night and saw shadows crawling towards me. They lifted from the floor and made squishy noises like they were made of slime putty. I screamed for my mom but she didnt come. One of the shadows got on the bed and I felt it crawling towards me. Threw my flashlight at it. It must have landed on the switch, because it lit up and the shadows disappeared under the bed.* I remember keeping the door open because the room smelled awful and desperately needed to be aired out. I always keep the door shut so at least one room is devoid of cat fur. I would have opened the window instead of the door, but it has been stuck since the move and no amount of force has managed to pry it loose. I had no choice but to leave the door open all day and overnight. I was pleasantly surprised that the cat did not even try to step foot inside. **Entry 9 November 5th, 2014:**
*Mom has been keeping my door open. Deacon is getting really angry with her. He says hes going to have to deal with her soon. I warned her Deacon was getting mad, but shes still insisting Deacon isnt real. Stupid stupid stupid. Deacon is watching.* That entry is the last one in the journal. If that wasnt creepy enoughheres the really weird thing: Im single and I live alone with my cat. I do not nor have I ever- had a child. I dont know what to say: maybe its a bad prank, but I checked the file properties and it was created in July and last updated on November 5th. I havent had houseguests since late October. My computer is not synched up to any device, nor does it have the capability to do so. I noticed the entries are typically written every other Wednesday, so I am curious to see if there will be a new one tomorrow. If there is, I will give you guys an update. **Update (November 19th, 2014):** I barely slept last night. I decided to check the journal before I went to work. I dont even know what to say. To say that I am horrified is putting it lightly. Here is the entry:
**Entry 10 November 19th, 2014:**
*Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for you. Deacon is real and hes coming for youunless the shadows get you first.* I think I am going to stay at a motel tonight. **Update (November 24th, 2014):** I just wanted to give you guys an update. I think I am freaking myself out over nothing. Ever since I read the journal, I keep seeing things move around in the dead of night. Around 3:00 a.m. this morning, I got up to use the restroom and saw my cat standing in the kitchen. He walked towards his food bowl and I heard a familiar crunching sound. I left him alone and went back to bed. As I slipped under the covers, my foot grazed my cat's head and he gave me an insulted, half-asleep meowl. There's no way he ran past me from the kitchen into my room: the hallway is too narrow. I would have seen or felt him. I was probably just sleep-deprived and imagined seeing him in the kitchen. People asked to see the drawing I found in Ryan's journal. It has been uploaded: [Ryan's Drawing](<URL>)",I cried myself to sleep.,6177,0,1

Its not like I wanna go around killing people, its just Ive lost my concern of something being a sin or not. Maybe because of that, Im not afraid of dying anymore.

The symptoms only get more pronounced and it's really hard to ignore such things as extreme light sensitivity or numbness of the skin. Did you also experience pseudo-physical symptoms and how did you deal with them, did they pass? It's very frustrating to have a day where you definitely feel a bit better than yesterday, just to be back to ""normal"" the next day.

An adolescent, maybe 16 or 17. More attractive than me, wearing black jeans and a shirt I forgot I had. He smiled at me in a way that I never smile now. Naturally, and genuine. Ten years ago this was me. For what was either 2 seconds or 5 minutes we stared at each other. How do I explain myself? I just wanted to tell him how sorry I was. What I had done to this kid. But before I could speak he started. This was a point in life where I could have branched off into a dozen different directions. His demeanor was so casual. I was standing in silence, holding back tears. He didnt seem sad, or distraught. No, he wouldnt have been those things.

This isnt what I wanted for you, none of it. we both stood in silence and his demeanor changed to serious. He started softly, I might be standing here. But Im still a part of you. We did go through a lot. And Im sorry too for how things turned out. He stepped forward and hugged me and then whispered, but now its time to make things better. I was confused. What do you mean?

I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. Who isn't hungry when they wake up? There was hardly anything to eat other than the cereal in the corner pantry which never seems to run out. I shouldn't even be eating this cereal because of my alergies, but it keeps my stomach full. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation? I put the milk back in the mini fridge in the corner. The only other room I have access to is the restroom. It's been getting more and more empty every day. Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and noticed my toothbrush was gone. I at least used mouth wash to help my mouth feel fresh. Then I got to doing the only thing I know that takes the migrane away. Playing games. I have at least a dozen board games to play with and even a bunch of video games from the 1990s. I had plenty to keep myself busy and entertained. What sort of game will I have to resort to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable. So I went to a board game today. I pretend there are four other players there. I roll play them. Their names are Dan, Nathan, and Felix. They play with me. We're all psychic. Only with each other. It makes Clue no fun. I'm just waiting for that to disappear so I don't have to look at it any more. Today I found this journal and a pensil. I think they want me to write in it, so I am. I can use it to keep notes for myself about what I've been playing them. Soon I'll hear the knocking. That's when I have to go to sleep. The knocking just keeps hapenning if I don't. I can't open the door. I'm not allowed. ---
Day 7
I woke up with a migrane. The same migrane I've been having every day when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. I was hungry. Of course I was. It was the same thing yesterday and it's going to be the same thing today. What's a rash on my arms compared to days starvation? I keep telling myself so I can put up with the symptoms. Today, after I ate my breakfast, I went to brush my teeth and remembered that my toothbrush had disappeared. The mouth wash was gone too, as if it had vanished. I couldn't do anything but leave my mouth rinsed with hot water. I was prepared to take a shower today, but the shower curtain disappeared as well as the showerhead. I got back to playing games again. What sort of games will I be here to when I'm done with all of these? Whoever put me here already thought of that. The games are very replayable. I'm rewriting this to remind myself that the games are worth it. They're worth it over laying all day with a head-ache. I can't sleep as long as the light is kept on. So I went to a board game today.

I'm going to test to see if they take these pages too. It's almost time for me to get to sleep. With a migrane of course. ---
Day 8
I'm still waking up with a migrane. It's still not changing. The migrane I bear while I'm not playing. I'm beginning to smell. Is this waht they want? For me not to be able to do what I want? The cereal changed, but I'm still alergic to it. The rash is still just as bad from this one as it was from the last. I'm getting a bit sick of the board games. Some of them are missing. I won't be able to finish the game of Life I started yesterday. It was a 1 vs 1 match between Dan and me. I'm digging into the video games now. One system, one controller, one TV. All in my one little room. You know, if you don't count the restroom. i don't even count it as a room anymore. Nothing but a couples towest and toilet paper. I kept myself entertained for the entire day. Not very hard. I got through three simple games. My head didn't feel too great while switching, but a few minutes at a time isn't nearly as bad as the hours I spend waking up and going to sleep. My last pages were missing. I'm wondering why you're taking them. Why do you want my random thoughts? What the fuck is this going to prove? I don't even know where I am. ---
Day 9
I still don't have a goddamn clue. What the hell do you want? Stop taking my pages. I just want to be able to re-read them once. Why are you making them disappear? What else are you going to make disappear? I'm out of food. What more can you take away from me. You can't possibly think I'd rather be hungry than have a rash. I'm getting sick from the hunger. It's almost worst than the pain in my head. Is this the kind of notes you want? The games are still keeping me entertained. They're keeping the headache away while they can. The ones I played yesterday are gone. If I'm not allowed to play games more than once, I'll eventually be left with nothing but a headache. ---
Day 10
Bastards. The first thing to go was my bed. Then the chairs. Then the table. Eventually, everything else. What good is a game without the controller? What good is this last board game without others? Without friends? Without companionship? This experiment is worthless. What you're doing is worthless. You're worthless. Am I worthless? Is that it? Am I just a worthless mouse to you?

Grow up and learn that life isn't meant to be wasted on sleep. Unless you're younger than 5 years old, you should have enough sense to know you can't just ignore life and go back to sleep. If you can't handle whatever it is you're waking up for, then you don't need/want it bad enough. I work 60+ hours a week and go to school 10 hours a week. I have a house to maintain and food that doesn't cook itself. I get about 4-5 hours of sleep per night sometimes less. I know to have a house to maintain and food to cook, I have to work as much as I do. If I want these things without having to work as much, I have to complete my education to have the higher paying position. If I'm late for work or school, I risk those things. I wake up and stay awake. I'm aware this won't be a popular post and not just for grammatical reasons. I'm simply expressing my thoughts as a response to the original question.

I remember what everything was like before that one dreadful morning that I awoke to my wife and kids no longer being in my home. I never told you guys about that did I? Well, I suppose I should. I started off the morning by thanking God for my day off. I saved my wife some time by packing the kids lunches, before sending them off to their bus stops with a kiss on the cheek. Christina and I spent half an hour on the couch cuddled under a blanket. The times alone with each other were the best. It reminded us of when we were first dating. If there really is a Heaven, thatll be it. I guess Ill find out. Ill be there soon. After taking the shot, and taking a quick picture, I sped off down the alleyway. I tried to scream but no sound came out of my mouth. I tried to cry, but no tears would come. I heard my laptop emit the sound of a received email. The last email I hope to get for a long time. It gave me a name and the address. The name was ZACHARY and after putting the address into Google, I saw that it led to an old junk yard on the outskirts of town. Zachary must be 000000000, and he was the last person Id have to kill before this sick shit was over. Id be able to see my family again. I stopped at the gun store one more time. I purchased a revolver, I wasnt going to get in a gunfight with a bolt-action .22. I remember the man asking me what I planned to do with it, and I remember walking out the door not saying a word. I was dead tired by the time I finished everything. I went back to the seedy hotel I had taken residence, and fell asleep upon hitting the bed. I had nothing but nightmares, seeing my kids being shot in the head by an unstoppable figure. Watching my wife asphyxiate and die from seemingly nothing. My family suffering while a distant voice whispered I hope you find them over and over again. Despite the terrors that plagued me at night, I awoke at noon. I got up and stepped into the shower. The mirror was fogged by the time I got out. I was relieved. I cant look at what it reflects, all I see is someone who killed an innocent family. Someone who ruined peoples lives for his own personal gain. I couldnt look at that person right now, and honestly I dont think Ill ever be able to. The drive to the junkyard was only a 30 minute drive, but to me it felt like hours. I shouldve been eager. One pull of the trigger and Id be able to hold my wife in my arms, Id be able to wake my kids up for school. I wasnt though. I felt like I was going to vomit the whole time. I made sure to drive past the junkyard to a rest stop half a mile away. If Zachary was still there, I didnt want him to know I was coming. It was a short 10 minute walk. The fenced-in junkyard was littered with cars, any one of them could be hiding the grieving man who was more eager to kill me than I was to kill him. I scanned the area and noticed a light being emitted from the broken window of a car. I crouched down, pistol in hand, and began inching my way to the car. I was about 20 feet away when I noticed that a man was sitting in the drivers seat of the car and the light was coming from his lap. He wasnt moving. Then the realization hit me. As I moved closer, I noticed that the broken window had blood splattered all over it. I got up and walked over to the drivers side door. Upon opening it, Zacharys arm slumped over towards where the door once was. His expressionless face was covered in flies and all sorts of insects. I glanced down and noticed that his phone was on, all it showed was the picture of his dead wife. The picture I sent to him. I realized that after receiving the picture of his dead wife, Zachary had shot himself. An uncontrollable rush of tears flooded to my eyes. Im sorry I muttered, Im so sorry
I mustve sat with my back against the car for a good hour. I couldnt help but cry. I couldnt get over the fact that I had killed this man and his family for me. For what I wanted. I pulled my digital camera from my pocket and took a picture of the dead man slumped over in his car seat, and sent it to 000000001. After a few mintues, my laptop dinged. It was email from 000000001. All it said was Theyll be waiting for you at home. I didnt head straight home. I stopped at the hotel first. I couldnt go home just yet. I couldnt face my family after what I had done. This is the 2nd day Ive been in this hotel room. The nightmares persistently invade my sleep. They consist of nothing but screams emanating from every direction, and re-runs of me killing Zacharys family, Zachary pleading for me to stop all the while. The nightmares persist even into my awake life. Ill be watching TV or otherwise trying to take my mind off things when a flashback of me ending someones life occurs. I see my revolver out of the corner of my eye, resting on the table as I type this update. I keep thinking back to Zachary, and how much I envy him. He got to escape all the misery and discomfort with one pull of a trigger. I wonder if hes happy now. I think Ill ask [him](<URL>).","I tried to cry, but no tears would come.",892,0,1

I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now.

Knowing you guys are facing your own battles AND WINNING, gives me strength. Let me share my story now. I'm a nursing student and my clinical instructor saw I was having some anxiety and clinical. So she set up a 4 part plan to help me. The last step was to go into a room that REALLY scares me...this is the the room where I started having panic attacks two years back. I agreed with 3 of the 4 step plan and told her that I was really uncomfortable with the 4th step. That it wouldn't help me and that anxiety doesn't just go away that easily. You can't just put someone in front of their stimulant and just expect things to get better, nevertheless, she did. I went into that room today...and I was doing well until half way through. Then one word from an instructor on just turning an IV bag upside down and I froze. I was useless. I became excessively hot, sweating, shaking finger, heart palpitations, the works.

s_1907_9,Find evidence for psychomotor in this post,"My boyfriend of three years has depression and I'm struggling what what to do? He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors). When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact. I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while. I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice, we laugh like we always do. Good things are happening with his job and he is doing really well and has applied for a promotion. I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family in months - I have gone to see his. He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner we reluctantly went out for (something he would usually offer on our anniversary). He has been going on nights out with his friends. I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different. We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive. When we do see eachother we cuddle and it's nice but it's not the same intimacy and I don't know when his sex-drive is going to be back...
I am really struggling with knowing what to do, I miss him and feel so so lonely even though he is in my life, and because I feel like this I want to confide in him but I can't.

( So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks! It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time. This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.
I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. * Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*
So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.) When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, ""Well duh stupid emo"" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever. The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, ""No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again."" I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad. The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, ""Always be happy"" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. ( Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss!

I'm currently in high school and plan on pursuing a carrer in musical theatre. It has always been what I wanted to do. I know it's difficult and very likely that I will always be poor, but I'm okay with that because it made me happy and nothing else did. Recently my sister told me that I was a bad actor, and went into vivid detail of why she thinks so. She was angry with me at the time, but has never taken it back. Now every time I'm with my voice teacher I become insecure with myself and feel horrible for the next few days. I don't know what to do. I just feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and that I'm making a mistake... I don't know, I just feel awful.

s_2135_7,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Getting my ADHD diagnosis and meds was the best thing that ever happened to me. I've had depression several times and always been anxious and felt like I was not dumb, but that I was dumb if that makes sense? I've had toxic relationships because I never felt good enough due to me being ex bad at listening at times, distracted, ""lazy"" with house work and just extremely self conscious, which made me feel like everything I did was wrong. I've had a hard time following through on projects, could not focus in school or do homework, even tho I was bright enough and had a lot of sexual issues as well. Last summer/fall I got a major depression. The worst I ever had. I never took medication for my depressions, as a friend of mine took bad antidepressants and got all fucked, so that scared me. But this time I was SO miserable, that I just wanted it to be fixed and after struggling with our mental healthcare system (I live in Denmark) for months and being send around to new psychiatrists who needed to interview me for 1-2 hours from scratch each time and then decide I was not their field, I finally got to an amazing psychiatrist. I asked all the others, if I could possibly be diagnosed with ADHD, but they all specialized in depression and send me around. I did not even ask my psychiatrist about it, she just said that I might have ADHD and we needed to look into that and then I got my diagnosis and started drugs. The drugs changed my life. One brand made me extremely nauseous, but the ones I have now only have a few side effects (I do not have a lot of appetite and used to be eating and snacking ALL THE TIME, so this thing with eating when not hungry and remembering to eat is a bit of a challenge, but it is working out now). But I do have a much easier time focusing. Both on smaller tasks at hand, like reading an e-mail or making coffee without burning myself, but also on organizing my stuff, cleaning and my job. I also feel calmer and fresher at the same time, which make social events and being around my partner much easier and I feel more connected to my body and more present, which makes it easier for me to be the person I want to be. Both in terms of job and social/romantic realtionships. I also sleep better and are much less anxious. I still have a bit of ADHD symptoms of course, but I fell much less embarrassed and in control of myself and my diagnosis have also learned me to cope with it mentally. To give myself permission to be different and not aim to do everything perfect all the time. I am working on the stuff, I want to change (like talking a lot), but also accepting that it is a part of me and that I have to live with that I don't use my diagnosis as an excuse, but as a reason. I'm not perfect and that is okay. I try my best and don't always succeed, but I do try my best, and that is the best I can do. I also try to explain, what I am experiencing to my friends, partner and family, so they can understand better, that when I ex talk for one hour about something completely boring and they tell me something important and I don't listen, it is not because I feel more important than them or do not have any interest in them they just need to tell me; ""Now I want to say something important"" and I'll focus on listening. And I am aware, that this is something I do and I work to change it, but beating myself up about it all the time, even tho I hate it, just gives me anxiety and makes it even harder to control myself. I also feel much less overwhelmed/fussy/like my head is melting after having to focus or meet people. I sleep better at night. I feel better about myself and have more energy to change or do stuff in my life, to make it better applying for a challenging, but interesting job or just organising my clothes, so it is easier to find what I need. And I am in a healthy relationship, where I am not being a childish bitch or being exploited or dependent. I just feel happy, calm and WORTHY. I've never felt worthy before and I have dated TRASH, that was definitely less worthy than I... I would like to end by saying, that my meds stopped working hours ago, as I had an early morning and here it is now late night. So while writing this I am both tired and my ADHD is full-blown active, which might be why I wrote so much and almost don't remember what I wrote. Sorry about that. But yeah, the diagnosis and the meds DEFINATELY changed my life for the better. And I've only been taking them for half a year, but that half year has been the best ever. I feel so much in control of myself and my destiny or at least in control of accepting the stuff and can't control.","I just feel happy, calm and WORTHY.",3923,0,1

I also just got unemployed for failing to pass my ptcb which is my pharmacy tech test. And to finally add the icing to the cake my ex girlfriend who used to be the only sun shine in my life is living the time of her life attending one of the best schools In the states. I also hate the fact that she's the only girl I hangout with.! Even though I enjoy her company it makes me feel like a pathetic loser when I hangout with her due to the fact that she is makes friends constantly at school( while getting hit on a dating other people), she also has a nice job, and is acing school. How do I turn my life around I'm tired feeling like a loser and letting people down. I struggle with depression... but sometimes I feel like that's an excuse now.","All my life I have struggled with my insecurities and the lack of confidence which has resulted in me to get no where in life, which in turn makes me feel like a constant failure.",197,6,1

If you have access to modern medical care then I think that you should try every antidepressant available to you before you consider killing yourself. At the same time, I recognize that what I went through is no life worth living.

It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone. My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later. I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy.

Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income.

I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days.

That wasnt too difficult to obtain. A quick few ads on Craigslist, a couple pictures sent back and forth, and a meet up. An hour later, Id have a condom full of what I needed. I gave the drugs a week to kick in before doing anything else. They made me dizzy and nauseous. Small price to pay, I guess. For the next part, I had to inject the sperm into myself. I had to try lots of spots; I was aiming for where I thought ovaries would be. I figured an ectopic pregnancy was still a pregnancy. And maybe the doctors could fix it if I was lucky enough to encounter that problem in the first place. The needles were long and fat and the contents were cold from the refrigerator. In that week, Id been with 30 men. My body ached and my self-esteem was gone, but theyd given me what I required. I injected myself with all of it over the course of the day.

Currently I hover around 7075 kgs which is ideal with my height and gets me the tall and lean frame which I like. I am not paranoid over diets and counting calorie intake and maintaining a deficit. I just listen to my body, so to say, and did the below mentioned things at the time which helped me lose all that weight (and get a jawline which I didnt know I had) Strictly no sugar no sweets, no adding it over curd, no pastries. This was the hardest because I love Gulab Jamuns and pastries. Working out. Not being a gym freak, but my regimen had lots of cardio and limited lifting. I also love CrossFit and incorporated it in my regimen. Intermittent fasting. Eat nothing for 16-hours. Have your food in an 8-hour period. LOTS of walking. I never counted the steps at the time, but I walked A LOT. And its one of the major factors to help you in losing weight. Eating Makhanas (Fox Nuts) while binge watching. Highly recommended binge-watching snack. One light meal of Poha/Upma/Dalia/Khichdi every day. Eggs amp; chicken are good for proteins but I avoided non-veg during that time. No drinking. Beer might be a boon to give you the courage to finally text her, but beer belly is a bitch that doesnt leave. There wasnt much fat shaming. Im 61 so no one would have said that I looked like someone who was close to a 100-kgs. I have never posted a picture of me from that time because I never clicked many, and those which I have, I still dont have it in me to post them online. I was low on self-esteem. Things werent going right in my life. Had my first breakup and it ripped me to pieces for months, maybe a year, maybe more. And I wanted to make a career in writing but didnt know where to start. Losing all that weight changed my outlook on life. Made me more mature. Made me see through people and realise my priorities.

Friday night was hell for me, though. I took a nap after dinner and woke up to what I thought was an immediate panic attack. Rapid heart rate, the urge to get up and move, and a feeling of uneasiness lasted for **3 hours.** I was in hell, so i had my husband take me to a non-hospital ER. I was diagnosed as severely dehydrated, hooked up to an IV, and began to feel a little better. Then the doctor finds what he thinks is a bacterial middle ear infection. So I've been dizzy and my slight fever hasn't gone away even with antibiotics. I went back to a regular doctor today. She says I have a viral inner ear infection, explaining my dizziness and my fever being unresponsive to antibiotics. She gave me an EKG to see how my heart's doing, and just noticed a slight raise in HR (108 bpm), which usually happens to me when I'm sick or in pain. I've still been having very mild anxiety spells, though, followed by 30 minutes of me obsessively checking my pulse every 4 minutes or so. Probably doesn't help the situation. Does anyone know if this can be caused by the dizziness I'm experiencing? Also, I've been having panic spells lasting about 3 minutes after I wake up, and I can't stay asleep for more than 90 minutes at a time. My doctor couldn't explain this but I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.

s_2958_116,Find evidence for special case in this post,"I feel like my need for meaning is alienating. Do any of you feel this way? Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues. Do any of you feel the same way? Do you have any experiences to share?",An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills.,141,9,1

s_473_485,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"Actually, I *am* extremely paranoid in regards to unplanned pregnancy. You can thank pro-choicers for instilling a zero tolerance of risk in me in regards to this. After all, I heard pro-choicers complain many, many times about contraception and sterilization failure. However, unlike these pro-choicers, I simply don't have the option of abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, which in turn means that I absolutely cannot risk an unplanned pregnancy in the first place. Also, abstaining from sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me. However, in addition to this, I did say that I am interested in using female hormones and reducing my sex drive, both of which is accurate. After all, I have heard (from both trans-women and trans-men) that female hormones make one more emotional, which is certainly something that I want. Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to. Plus, I have heard that female hormones increase the length of one's orgasm and make one body sexually aroused in a different way, both of which I would certainly like to try out. Also, I would like to have a more feminine face so that I would develop a more androgynous appearance. In addition to this, though, I absolutely hate all of my body hair and facial hair and thus want to permanently get rid of as much of it as possible. This hair makes me feel dysphoric and I would prefer that all of it simply disappeared and never grew back. After all, I would like to have a more feminine and ""clean"" appearance as well as to cross-dress at times.","Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to.",935,1,1

s_2180_5,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Vent Post: Process of Looking for Apartments/Moving Out, Fear, Doubts, Setbacks, ""Good Faith Deposits,"" Intuition vs. Paranoia I have another vent, been stressing, doing research all night and didn't get any sleep (not that I am tired). Quick Background:
- Horrible Soul crushing living situation that brings me pain/fear all the time. - Unemployed but have savings to last a couple of months if I find a place. Not looking for a job until I find and have a stable place. - Been looking for sublet Craigslist apartments for months on months, as far back as March/April. It's been so long because I haven't been full-time/all the time. I've also been looking for sublets (between 2-6 months), somewhere I can clear my head, collect myself, get a job, save money, and eventually find more stable/longer term place. Lastly it's taken so long mostly because of fear/anxiety. Just looking at Craigslist housing posts used to cause stomach-aches. It still does but less and I know that I need to get out/have my own space. My situation:
I found a place on Craigslist a week ago. I spoke to someone and went to see the place on Tuesday. There were 2 other people looking for the place too. BTW that took strength, I was soo afraid. My stomach hurt and I was nervous. Thank God my mom was there in case I had a panic attack. Anyway I like the place and I want it. The leasing manager/who is also an individual broker said if I want to continue forward with the process I have to do an application online. She emailed me the instructions and the application link. I filled out the application and submitted the required documents (I did everything online the same night). BUT THERE IS A CATCH. I must send a $500 deposit/closing fee to hold the apartment. In turn she will take it off the market. If I am approved then we will continue the process. I am assuming that means (getting/signing a lease). If I am not approved she will return the deposit back to me. Keep in mind that I haven't been approved, haven't seen or signed a lease, and I haven't met the landlords/homeowners. Even so, I have am having serious fear, doubts about this ""Good Faith Deposit"" process. I am afraid as soon as I put in the deposit she is going to run off with my money and I won't have any way of tracking her. As I already said I am unemployed but I do have savings and good credit. I have enough savings to last the whole 6 months of the leasing term. Even so, I am not loose or risky with my money. My family has always been struggling with money my entire life and I don't want to make mistakes and do stupid things with my hard earned money. I also have a cautious/plan everything nature. I did mad research. I looked up her name on the state department, I looked up the landlord/house owners property records. Everything seems legit. I looked up housing policies and it isn't unusual or illegal to do ask people for a holding or ""Good Faith Deposit"" before getting approved, looking at and signing a lease and meeting the landlords/property owners. I really don't want to be duped. I can't afford to fall for a scam. I really don't want this to be a scam. $500 is a lot to lose for someone who doesn't have a job, and has hang ups about spending money. I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it. Right now I am waiting to hear back from the leasing manager. I sent her an email with a bunch of questions (such as asking for an electric copy of the lease and getting this ""Good Faith Deposit"" thing in writing with signatures) and I may meet up with her to see the place again later on today. In the meantime while waiting I am freaking out. I don't want to lose out on this place but I also don't want to be scammed/made a fool of. All this fear makes me question if this is my intuition talking or my paranoia. Part me wants to just pay the deposit and see what happens and the other part is like no bitch (like what if I get stuck in a bad leasing situation). Like what should I do? How can I assure myself? How can I have faith?",I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it.,3232,6,1

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong.

s_982_722,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"I attempted suicide. Some of you will know me for the post that almost nobody could read. Here's a link in case you don't know what I'm talking about. <URL>
Don't worry, I'm not posting anything like that again. I've learned my lesson, and it drove me near to death's cold hand. I tried starving myself to death. Alone, isolated, and hungry, I collapsed from hunger 12 days into the fast. I was absolutely prepared to die, but I woke up mere hours later in the hospital. I gave my family an extreme heart attack. They asked why I did it, and I told them the whole story. A few weeks ago, I met a girl online. It was through her older sister. On YouTube, she left a comment on one of my videos saying it made her day and that she had been contemplating suicide as well. Two days later, she decided against it. It wasn't just chatting with me. She liked the company she had at home which also convinced her, and it included her sister. When the girl and I were talking on Skype, she had to step away. Her little sister filled in for her. She and I shared pictures and decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend after just an hour of chatting. She stayed on social media for as long as she could just to see if I would log on. I would go on just to talk to her. But, suddenly, she just vanished from social media. Her older sister said she had committed suicide herself. A knife through the stomach. Bled to death. Despite telling my family all of this, I conveniently left out the part about writing a cipher and trying to reach her through a public message. Who the hell would believe that? I don't even believe she heard me anymore. I was told all my life that people who commit suicide neither go to heaven nor hell. Somewhere different. A special limbo of unforgiving nothingness I guess. I wanted to say a proper goodbye. I found a cipher online. If I encrypted a letter to her and posted it somewhere public, she would get the message as soon as someone could decipher it. The rules were simple. People had to see it publicly and I couldn't tell anyone is was a cipher, I couldn't tell anyone to decipher it, and I couldn't give anyone the solution. The last rule is I could only post it to one website and only once on that website. I posted to reddit. Other sites were no good since I had no friends to see it, and they wouldn't care. And then they would know about my online relationship. The creepypasta subreddit was perfect. I would have someone decipher it and not think I was serious. But I still wanted to see her. My poor logic clouded my better judgment. The foggy road led to one place for all suicides. All suicides lead to Rome? If I was dead, I was going to see her. That's how it worked in the way I thought about it. But I'm not brave enough to plunge a knife through my heart or jump off a building. And now my memory of the cipher feels fuzzy. Everytime I think about it, I seem to remember it less, and it causes me to feel desperate to see her. Ill be in therapy for a while to get over this.

s_891_1154,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I'm 45 But I Have Only Lived Through 19 Years As of right now I am 45 years old, but I have only really lived 19 years. Since I was young my life would jump forward every time something terrible would happen to me. The first time it happened was when I was 6 years old. That is the year that my father was involved in a hit and run. I remember wanting to cry, but before I knew it I felt like all of my grief was gone. I felt at piece, but I felt extremely different. My mother came in my room and told me to get ready for school. Somehow I knew where all of my clothes were, but they felt like they were much too big to fit me. When I put my shirt and pants on I realized they fit me perfectly. I went into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth, but when I walked in I saw my own reflection. I was a lot taller than before, and my face looked a lot more different. When I ate my breakfast my mother dropped me off at a middle school. After 30 seconds of confusion I suddenly knew which class to go to, and who my friends were. I knew that I was in 7th grade since I was now 12. I knew that I had a bully, but he was never really that bad. His name was James, and he was always yelled at by his mother when she picked him up from school. My friends name was Brian and he was obsessed with his music. Everything was okay with my life for the next two years. I met my first crush, but she never liked me back. Brian and I grew closer every day since we had the same classes, and James ended up moving away. Everything was fine until my 14th birthday when my grandfather had a heart attack in our living room while I was blowing out my candles. After my mother received a call telling her that my grandfather didnt make it I started to cry. Just moments later I open my eyes to find myself sitting at a red light. I looked to my left expecting to see my mother driving, but found a steering wheel in front of me instead. That is when I had my first meltdown. I screamed at the mirrors that showed a face of a grown man, and I punched the steering wheel until my hands filled with pain. I looked outside the car window when I managed to calm down and realized that everything was different. I knew I was in the same city I always lived in, but there were stores I never even heard of. The park I used to go to all of the time was torn down and replaced with a mattress store. When I heard the car behind me honking I started to drive to my house. I dont know how I knew how to drive, but somehow I knew what to do and it felt completely natural. I got to my house to see an old lady sitting outside of the house. When I approached her to ask her if she were lost I was struck with the realization that it was my mother. Fragile and old, but still sitting there with the smile she always had for me. She asked me how I did on the first year of college and I numbly told her that I received all As and made it to the Deans list. I told her I was feeling sick and she told me to go to my room with a worried look on her face. When I got to my room I sat on my bed and began to remember everything that happened the last 7 years. Brian moved away when I was 13, and my favorite math teacher was found dead and lying on his desk completely still. He was dead for 8 hours before they found him. Not much happened afterwards. I graduated high school and went to my first year of college. The girl that I had a crush on is now my girlfriend. We havent had sex yet, but we both decided to wait until we were married. After four years I graduated college and immediately found a wonderful job as an editor. The day I graduated I got on one knee to propose to the love of my life and she said yes. We decided that the next September would be the best time for us to get married to get ourselves financially and emotionally prepared. Three months before our wedding my fianc passed away in a hospital. Knowing what would happen and the depression of her dying hit me at once and I unwillingly started to cry. I then found myself sitting in a coffee shop drinking a regular iced coffee. I look around to see where I am and found myself in the city I grew up in, but this time everything was different. People have started to look lifeless and uninterested with whatever they were doing. A baby was sitting at the table next to me just staring at me without any type of emotion. The mother took a look at me and said What the fuck are you looking at? I was blown away not by her statement but by how monotone she said it. I turned around and sat silently. I know that I am now 32 and I befriended James when he moved next door to me. The fact that he bullied me when we were so young did not affect how close we ended up getting. Two years after we became friends James was found in his living room with his intestines wrapped around his head and his organs spread around his body. Before I start remembering anything else I ran to my mothers house to make sure she was still alive. When I was 3 houses away I saw that my mother was rocking back and forth in her favorite chair outside. I go up to her and try to hug her, but she pushed me off and resumed rocking. I looked at her, but she refused to turn my way. When I turned her to face me I fell back onto the ground. Her face was the same but her lips were placed in a frown that immediately told me she hated everything about me. Her eyes were pure black as she said Dont fucking touch me again if you want to keep your hands. It was monotone, but it made me start to shake in fear. I went three streets over to my house and I laid in my bed for the next three days trying to figure out what the hell was happening. After three days I ran out of food so I went to the store. Again, everyone is expressionless and just going through the motions of shopping. One person was lying on the floor acting like he was walking. I stared at him for a couple of minutes thinking of a way to help him, but a lady hit him with the cart and started to drag him away. I decided right then and there to just live my life as if nothing was different. I got another job as a salesman and nothing happened for the next 5 years. After five years I decided to revisit my mother. I drove there and pulled into her driveway. She was still rocking on her chair and I walked up to her. I grabbed her shoulder and lifted her head thinking she just drifted off, but her head fell off her neck and into my hands. I screamed and dropped her head and it rolled to the side of my foot. I look down and see that her face is littered with holes all across her face. Maggots were going in and out of the holes and I turn around and go to my car. I start to cry and I know that I am about to lose even more of my life. I woke up and found myself in a chair. The chair that is in front of the computer I am posting this on now. To tell you all that I remember everything now. About how I poisoned my math teachers apple I gave him at five pm after he tutored me. I dont know why I did it, but I was tired of seeing people I cared about dying all around me. I remember slicing Jamess stomach open and ripping out his intestines and wrapping them around his face. I took out his organs and spread them all around him. They never found his heart because I buried it beside the tree we would always sit at and drink beers together. I am just tired of seeing people dying all around me, and I dont know why people have stopped showing emotions. I dont know why my mother was dead for so long without anybody alerting the police or even an ambulance. All I know is that I am not going to lose any more of my life.

s_1900_175,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 2 So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------
**UPDATE**
So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------
**FINAL UPDATE**
So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and ""earn my dinner"". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in. [](<URL>)",I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time.,8814,0,1

I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested. She was convinced that we would never work out and didn't want to 'waste her time' working on a relationship that was destined to fail. I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along. I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February. During that time she did basically everything she could to abandon me. She never visited, didn't bring our kids to see me, she only called me once. I found out after I was discharged that she started a relationship with a coworker while I was hospitalized. Now we barely communicate even though nothing has been finalized. We are working out a custody agreement but it's not finished and we haven't even discussed dividing assets other than cars. She's totally moved on with her other guy and I feel more and more lonely every day.

s_84_60,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I never met my father. In the past, I struggled often because I always see little girls holding fathers' hands and I get extremely upset/jealous a bit, maybe. Then I would get really angry at times. I wasn't really handling it well, growing up. I was also very fragile because I kept losing family members and friends (they died) around me. So it was difficult for my mother to be able to tell me. She wanted to wait until I get older; when I'm more mentally and emotionally prepared for the big, full story about my father. I was 24 years old when I found out. Father's Day rolled around in June 2013. Then I began to wonder about my father again. I haven't thought about him for a couple of years until for some reason, I wanted answers. I felt ready to know what kind of father he was. I researched, trying to find answers and I ended up finding his death certificate along with my half-brother's signature and phone number (I didn't know I had half-siblings). Sadly I found out he passed in February 2010. I was disappointed because I had planned on contacting him and try to get to know him and hope to meet him in person. But I finally got in contact with my half siblings (one half brother and one half sister) I never knew until two years ago and they told me many stories about him. Most of the stories weren't good, hence is why my mother protected me my whole life from not knowing what kind of father he was (he had a serious problem with alcohol and he was involved in drugs). So my mom finally told me her story and everything made sense from there. Even if I had meet him in person, I will end up feeling disappointed, seeing how my father turned out. I learned the hard way, so for me, it's better that I know what kind of person he was and I would be better off without him in my life. He wasn't a good person, especially to my half siblings. They had it really rough, growing up around him and especially when he ran out on them multiple times and is good at disappearing. He was no father figure. Regardless with the struggles, growing up, I turned out fine. I wouldn't be the person I am today. I look up to my grandfather, as if he's my father. I love him dearly. I love my family.

The room the four of us had chosen for training held the shape of a long and flat storage tank. Very similar to the space the Yngtaks had been held in, it could have supported our full thousand men, but it was one of dozens of such unused spaces and nothing had been inside it when we'd found it. It gave me the distinct sensation that I was inside an empty airplane hangar. Closer than those distant walls, though, my gaze bored into the upright metal plate before me. I called forth memories of those I lovedand, wrapped in those energies, gave the smooth chrome a solid punch with my gloved hand. While Celcus and Sampson stared, Flavia moved forward on her crutches to study the silvery fist-print. "" It's hot,"" she declared, pulling her finger back quickly. "" Probably from the stress on the metal itself."" She turned her head and narrowed her eyes at my undamaged knuckles. "" It's not just strength. You'd have to be more durable as well to not break your hand doing that."" It was rare that I felt this way. I was not immune to fear or anticipation, but, at that moment, I was actually *nervous.* What would they think of me? Asking them to accept that I romantically loved each of them had been harrowing enough, but now something even stranger was happening to me. Sampson clenched a fist and tensed his bicep to emphasize his thought. "" You do that by thinking of the qualities *we* possess?"" Honesty had not failed me in the caves. I decided that I needed to tell them everything now that I had told them anything. "" Well, for that punch, mostly thoughts of you."" Quickly seeing the confusion on their faces, I elaborated, ""When I need to be smart and analytical, I think of you"" I looked to Flavia. "" and when I need the self-awareness to balance more than one of these traits at once, I think of *you.*"" My tall man met my gaze with growing understanding. Celcus sank into thought. "" So you take on the strengths of those around you. Is it possible this is just a psychological effect? Maybe you can do these things because you believe you can."" Sampson gave a proud chuckle and raised a hand toward the damaged metal plate. "" You think *that's* just a product of belief?"" ""Human beings have been known to exceed their limits under extreme stress,"" Flavia mused. "" And of course we were trained to call upon those more costly layers of endurance at will. That may have helped her reach this place, but, no, this is beyond adrenaline factors. If she'd broken her hand with that punch, I'd have considered it likely, but no amount of stress can make bones and skin hardier."" My gaze kept jumping to each of them as they spoke. My fate was in their hands in a very unique and personal way. What if they chose to hate or fear me? What if
""Has anyone felt a drain during the events in question?"" Celcus asked, emerging from his deeper thoughts to look us in the eyes. "" Venita's described a handful of miracles in which she drew upon our strengths, but I don't recall feeling weakened during those moments."" Flavia froze halfway to speaking before reconsidering her words. "" I hadn't thought of that."" Looking down to spend a moment recalling, she then continued: ""I didn't feel weaker, either. ""Then that means she's not taking something from usshe's instinctively restructuring her own biology on the fly. Where would that energy come from?"" Taking a moment to study my face, she said in our formal dialectwhich we had not been able to use in quite some timea small modified phrase of wonder. The saying was normally *it is beyond belief, but my eyes prove it*; her statement was closer to, ""You are amazing."" My cheeks burned as I became acutely aware of their eyes upon me. That heat was matched only by the furnace in my heart. Desperate to shift attention away, I said, ""Energy? There's a sort of colored fire that burns in me."" Flavia took that in stride and moved closer on her crutches. "" I pointed to my heart. ""And what color?"" I wasn't sure why I found her line of questioning surprising, but I also realized that she couldn't see or feel it the way I could. "" She moved very close, as if in an attempt to see the fire through my very eyes. "" What *kind* of blue?"" Cheeks warming again due to her nearness, I gulped away a catch in my throat and offered, ""Lighter than cobalt, darker than cyan. Maybe azure to turquoise depending on intensity."" ""No hints of purple or green?"" I shook my head. She blinked, took that answer, and moved away while thinking. Celcus asked, ""Should we tell Septus? It doesn't feel right doing this without him."" ""I haven't known him as long as you,"" Sampson countered, ""But that likely makes me more objective. Anyone who listens to Conrad can't be fully trusted. This is too big. Too important."" My embarrassment at receiving personal attention faded in favor of my strategic senses. "" I think Conrad already knowsor at least suspects."" ""Yes,"" Flavia said from ten paces away while facing the empty distance of the white-lit hangar. "" He noticed you almost immediately, and his focus has only increased. I think he knew something was different about you from the moment your hand let us into his medical facility."" She turned around suddenly on her cast-clad leg. "" This has to be why your hand gets access from these places! Perhaps your biology reacts to what the system is looking for, or maybe there's some other element in you that only"" She froze. Celcus and Sampson were thinking it, but I was the one who asked, ""What?"" ""It's you,"" she breathed, staring at me. "" That thing Conrad said. The Sixth Millennial."" I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be set apart from my family. "" Flavia hobbled forward. "" What would the Machine Empress design her systems to look for in her absence if not the one thing that nobody else could replicate? A spark of some sortor a flame."" The words struck me like a hammer, and I lost all sense of where I was as I removed my glove and stared down at my own hand. I could see and feel blue fire moving along the nerves of that limb, palm, and digits; I could clench that energy and gather it up to strike, defend, or transform. It was emotionthe energy of emotion released from the mental realm and set ablaze in the physical. I still wore both my arm braces, but I doubted I needed the therapeutic one any longer. The multi-tool had become an extension of me, while the brace for my formerly broken arm had reached the end of its usefulness. There was someone else who needed it more. Carefully unclicking it and removing it, I handed the arm brace to Flavia. "" For your broken arm. Let's get that cast off."" She seemed taken aback by the gift. "" You don't need it?"" ""I don't think so. Not anymore."" ""Then forget the arm,"" she said with excitement. "" I'll use this thing on my leg so I can finally walk without crutches again."" Celcus asked, ""It can be resized like that?"" Already lifting her uniform's pant leg and cutting with her combat knife, Flavia used a term we had learned from the Vanguard: ""Duh."" We helped her remove the cast completely, and nobody mentioned the rather odious release underneath. The automatic systems inside the brace adjusted quickly to encircle, clamp, and support in the right places, and she stood with a mixed sigh. "" Hurts a little, but not with bone-pain. I think I'm just lucky it wasn't a worse break."" ""I would have given it to you sooner if I'd have thought it could be used on your leg,"" I told her, genuinely apologetic. How could I have failed to think of that? Her injuries had been sustained saving my life! My leg needed time to heal, and we've still probably put it on a little early, but I'm willing to trade some pain for mobility that might keep me alive in the coming days."" Celcus and Sampson both agreed with that, and the three of us watched as Flavia limped around the empty hangar with an exuberant smile. Raising her good arm, she aimed her pistol at the far wall a few times, testing her stance. "" I am half a warrior again."" ""Just half?"" Celcus called over with humor. ""Half an Amber soldier is more than enough."" For the next half an hour, my newly mobile beloved ran me through my paces like I was a first-year cadet, and, in some sense, I wasonly this academy was my own changing mind and body. At first, I was just happy that the people I loved accepted whatever this was, but then I, too, began sharing their excitement. Clicking her wrist-watch and comparing that number to our measurements of the hangar, she declared in Empire units in case Vanguard soldiers overhead us: ""Twenty one point one kilometers per hour. Not bad, but clearly a normal speed for a fit female our age. You weren't the fastest of us, either."" She readied her watch again. "" This time, think of Porcia. I set off around the lap we had demarcated with my thoughts focused on the fleetest of our family. She was gone, but her essence remained in my memories, and I could feel Septus' love for her keeping her with us as well. Celcus shouted; Sampson clapped once in surprise. I ignored their reactions in favor of reliving the adrenaline of the run I'd made against Conradand the lap was over before I could even really register beyond that. Flavia lowered her wrist-watch. "" Panting, I asked, ""What was the speed?"" She answered slowly, as if haunted. "" You didn't run the whole lap."" ""Of course I did."" I gasped for air as I regarded the course. "" I took each corner."" I took cues from my beloved men. "" Celcus and Sampson saw me run the whole thing."" Flavia accepted their nods, but still shook her head. "" You did go fast. Nearly double. I'd guess thirty-five to thirty-seven kilometers per hour. Amazing speed matching some of the best Amber sprintersmale ones, in fact. But *you didn't run the whole lap.*"" Confused and increasingly unhappy, I could only tell her, ""I don't understand what you mean."" She didn't seem to be able to blink. Her blue eyes remained on me; glinting moisture brimmed. "" I don't understand either, but you've done it once before."" ""Come on now,"" Celcus said, stepping between and breaking our line of sight. "" I saw her take each corner. How could she have turned four times but not run the whole lap?"" She gripped her forehead and turned away. "" I think maybe I'm just tired. I'm going to go rest in my room."" As I recovered my breath and watched her leave, I realized that I had seen through her eyes before and thus had some idea what was bothering her. She saw the world in a flurry of connections; a spider web of logistical axes bound by colored sums of a thousand hues and countless possible moments refracted like light through a prism made of time. She had never told anyone this, though I'd somehow drawn that aspect of her to me and seen through eyes tinted with her perspective when I'd raced Conradbut I myself had been the one thing I had not been able to observe. What had she seen in me with her unique vision that had disturbed her so? ""Yeah, time for a break,"" Sampson said, heading off as well. Only Celcus and I were left, and he asked as casually as he could, ""You and Sampson have fun last night?"" Snapped out of one frame and into another, I immediately replied, ""Yes,"" before thinking better of it. "" Well, we went for a walk. Does that... bother you?"" He tried to smile, but his answer was serious. "" I just hope you realize you're going to have to make some decisions soon. Let us know what you feel so that we don't have the wrong expectations."" What *did* I feel? I'd just taken off my arm brace, and that gave me the words. "" To deny any of you would be like cutting off one of my limbs. I can't do it."" His awkward shrugging and the masked pain on his face nearly broke my heart. He asked, ""Do you still feel the same about me?"" I did my best to convey everything I felt for him through an upwardly aimed kiss; my tall man had needed that, and he left with a lighter and reassured step. He was not wrong. I knew that I would have to do something soon. I'd been hoping the coming battle would delay personal decisions, but it was our instructors had told us: life doesn't stop for war. On my own journey through the halls, I remained quiet and brooding, but I could certainly feel the wordless attention of passersby. Human and Yngtak alike had seen me involved with the impossible, and I suspected Conrad might have been preaching something about me. Worse, I had no makeup to dull my appearance like I usually did back home, and I felt rather naked. One of the unpaired Vanguard men tried to stop and talk to me with a grin, but I made a polite excuse and practically ran away. Why did people have to look at other people that way? I just wanted to be an unremarkable part of a group. That way
That way I would never be alone. If I never took a personal risk, I would never risk losing the group, and I would never have to feel like I had felt *back then*. My feet no longer took me forward. Frozen in the middle of the hallway, I became aware of a fear that had likely been holding me back my entire life. I had not known myself. I had not had personal courage. I had not had the support and love I'd neededuntil now. My grandfather was a wonderful man, but he had not been able to fill the roles of an entire family. Now I had siblings in Trajan, Larentia, Paulinus, and Septus; an older sister in Caecilia; beloveds in Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia; a friend in Noah; andstrangest of all for me to recognizetwo crucial figures that fulfilled two very different but highly linked roles. Conrad approached down the hall as I stood waiting; he waved off his three lieutenants and they continued on, leaving us alone. He stood in silence, intrigued, until finally asking, ""Patience is not one of my virtues. Out with it girl."" As strange as it felt to consider this man as a partial filler of the missing role of father in my life, I had to say it: ""You've been trying to push me to improve, haven't you?"" His flat lips curved into a smile. "" I'll admit that, yes."" So it was true. I felt numb as I probed further. "" His head had gone from military near-baldness to hosting a short layer of brown hair in the time that I had known him; he ran his hand once through this now as he considered me with an only mildly unkind snicker. "" Do you think it's coincidence that the Sixth Millennial walked up to my door in humanity's hour of greatest need? Me, the one man above all others who knew the Fifth inside and out?"" So that, too, was true. I took a moment to breathe and guess at all the things I did not know because I had been raised not to ask questions. Darkness and light both had been glimmering outside the narrow purview of my personal concerns. How *dark?* "" Tell me all this isn't just to challenge me."" ""Not all of it, no,"" he said wryly at first; his smirk abruptly fell into dead seriousness. "" But I did send the signal to resurrect my wife because of you."" Cristina's desperate *why now?* echoed in my ears, and I took a step back. "" You""
""I suspected you from the very beginning,"" he continued. "" But I knew for certain when you helped me lift that door and free the Yngtaks. Not only did the energy you released heat the entire hallway full of water, I swam back there after and found your handprints on the bottom of the door. The outline of your fingers in *solid metal.*"" I couldn't deny it to him or to myself, not after what I'd done in secret only an hour before. The agenda behind this, though, had to be darker than I could imagine. "" You'd wake the monster behind the spheres just to spite me?"" He shook his head sadly. "" Look around you, Venita. These facilities were built to hold thousands, or even tens of thousands, not one woman. While I lost myself in dreams and nightmares, merciless boredom and hollow wonder eternal, Gisela built an entire empire for a people that exiled her long ago. More than that, she developed the technology for resurrectionDeath defeated! Truly slain!but then set the system not to bring her back unless I desired it, unless I came out of my eon of ennui and wanted to see her again. This was always a woman, not of evil, but of strong emotion. Whatever she may have become over centuries of solitude, she will never be a monster, just a worthy opponent."" The facilities. They'd been built so absurdly large. I'd never understood it. I'd wandered the floors, explored their labyrinthine depths, and marveled at the redundancy. I didn't trust Conrad, but I trusted that assessment of these factories and hospitals. They'd been built all over the region for capacity far beyond the needs of one lonely exiled Empress. "" But we're set to attack her main fortress."" He nodded carefully. "" We've been sending teams ahead with vehicles, supplies, and pallets of gear. They still can't come back until we win the day, but they *can* stock the million soldiers already laying siege. I've told them to spread the word that The Machine Empress of Mankind is about to resurrect."" A shiver of confusion ran through me. "" Have I misread you? Have you done all this with good intent?"" ""You misunderstand."" His smile became subtly mocking. "" They'll take it as an urgent omen of doom, not as a relief that this will all be over when she wakes up and turns off the artificial intelligence defense forces. They're making a grave error at my behest, and they'll deeply regret what happens after."" I stepped away with abject horror. Conrad's smile deepened as the full weight of what was happening hit me. We'd made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost had been our inevitably coming across and waking our immortal Imperator. My world had made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost would be a war with what the others had called a force on level with a god. The Fifth Millennial, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind, would easily destroy our Amber Worlds if so enraged. We'd been barely surviving trips across small portions of her realm. What could possibly stand against her in outright war? ""Yes,"" he said quietly as passersby approached. "" Things are going to be very hard for you shortly, but I think you'll rise to the task. If not, at least the battles will be entertaining as hell."" Acknowledging the passing soldiers, he nodded and headed away, completely unperturbed by our conversation. Don't panic. If my father figure was a manipulating bastard, then I needed his opposite. Bursting into her room after a mad dash, I shouted, ""Cristina!"" She looked up from her handheld tablet device. "" What's wrong?"" Hitting the button to slide the door closed behind me, I told her everythingthe testing, my discoveries, Conrad's tauntingand she listened and nodded along, unsurprised at any of it. "" Sit down, Venita."" I had never had the spotlight so directly focused on me by the course of events before, but my panic began to fade as I sat on the floor next to the bed and she began braiding my hair like she had that day at the river. ""Conrad told you what he told you for a reason,"" she told me with calm focus as she layered my hair back and forth behind my head. "" He's being both honest *and* manipulative. That's what makes his moves so effective. If he was lying, we could just find the truth, or even ignore himbut I have no doubt he believes what he's told you. Furthermore, he's calculated that revealing his intentions furthers his goals. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said anything."" Taking a deep breath and focusing my sight on the opposite metal wall, I asked, ""So he wanted me panicked? Wanted me distracted?"" ""I don't think so. It sounds like he's purposely given you fair warning. He wants you to grow stronger and face off against the Machine Empress. We can only speculate as to why, but, for the moment, our agendas align. We should work on getting you stronger."" She tugged down a few times before resuming. "" In the meantime, our mission will be to insert ourselves in the chain of command at the siege. * Somebody* from the Amber Worlds is in charge, despite the million men at large not publicly knowing."" ""Noah can sense Amber people,"" I told her. "" Or, rather, he *can't*, so he can pick them out of a crowd."" That's perfect. When the offensive begins, we'll join the tide, but we'll move to find the Amber soldiers and lie our way into the chain of command. After all, you *are* from Amber Three, and we'll know so much they'll have no choice but to believe us. The inability to get home means they won't be able to confirm with their headquarters any more than we will. Then we'll call off the attack."" All the terror that Conrad had instilled in me was gone. It was a solid plan. "" It might actually work."" ""It will."" She began working the longer ends of my braid. "" Right now, it sounds like you've got other things to worry about. Romantically, I only ever loved one person. Saw him in those Kansan wheat fields in his soldiering gear and decided he was it. But you've got yourself into a very tough situation. A team can't go into battle with confusion or pain between its members. And who knows who'll be part of the coming twenty percent? You have to live and love while you can."" She stopped just short of finishing my braid, and I guessed she was thinking of her lost husband. ""They calculated a twenty percent loss rate for the offensive?"" I asked, turning my head to the side to look up at her. ""No,"" she murmured. "" Twenty percent survival rate."" For the second time that day, true dread snaked its way around my heart. "" Twenty percent? * One in five?*"" There were five of us left in my squad! What if I was the only one who lived? What if all the
She snapped back to awareness and tied the end of my braid, finishing it. "" Don't let it get to you. It's just an estimate based on an incomplete model. We'll survive. We're not going to bear the brunt of those losses, remember? Our mission is orthogonal. And I would never send you into a murderous slugfest like that. The day is never won solely because of guns."" ""They sure help, though."" Pushing the dark snake away from my heart thanks to her calm confidence, I frowned. "" How do I choose?"" She let me up, and stood to walk me out. "" That's up to you. Nobody else can tell you how to live."" After activating the door and peering left and right, she told me, ""It's clear. Nobody saw you. I'm concerned he may have provoked you into running straight to the leader of the secret opposition faction, but, if you did have a tail, you lost them."" That brought a smile back to my face. "" I do run pretty fast these days."" She pushed me on my way. "" And don't worry. We'll survive what's coming."" I made it decently far away from her quarters before anyone saw me; meanwhile, I became preoccupied with the choice ahead. How could I possibly refuse what I felt for any of my three beloveds? Was it as simple as choosing the one whose potential loss most terrified me? That seemed like an odd thought in many ways. Something vital would be cut from me if I lost any of my threebut something vital would be cut from *them* if I remained vague and indecisive. While wandering the halls, I heard the words: ""It's better than *nothing!*"" I was walking along the second floor subsection C toward Sampson's quarters when a prickling along my skin stopped me in place. Without any other warning, two bloodied men in unrecognizable clothes fought hand-to-hand past the T-junction ahead. Shouting and punching one another, they were definitely engaged in a real and vicious fight. I only got a good look at oneand even then I saw only black hair and fierce eyesbut I absolutely heard him yell, ""The way *you* run things maybe!"" The two combatants moved beyond the end of the hall and out of sight. Dashing forward, I looked left and right down the junction, but they were nowhere to be seen. Had they fought around a corner or into one of the nearby rooms? I heard nothing, and the hallway was silent. To quote my Vanguard friend Sol: what *the hell* had that been? The hair on the back of my neck remained charged as I stood in that silent hall. I had the distinct impression of water flowing back into a hole and sealing it up; or of a plane flying over, full of lives that were crossing close by but which would never interact with mine. ""Venita,"" someone called, and I turned to see a doctor I recognized approaching. "" Did I hear right that you and your friends cut off Flavia's leg cast?"" Is everything alright?"" He came close and gave me a strange look. "" You know people don't normally do that kind of thing themselves. They usually get a doctor."" Some of his past comments and suspicions came back to me, and I had the sudden notion that he was somewhat cognizant of our differences from the rest of the Vanguard. "" Oh, um, we didn't want to bother you."" ""Is that so."" He took in a long draw of breath through his nose and let it out over the course of several seconds. "" Well, bother me in the future. It's why I'm here."" ""Of course. Thank you."" I watched him head on further down the hall before I resumed my course. Rather than head to Sampson's room, I chose my own, and I closed the door to find myself in rare solitude I had not experienced since that night at Conrad's medical facility. This factory had rooms for thousands of people, and thankfully so, for the Yngtaks alone took up two entire floors. I was tired of walking the crowded halls and running afoul of others. For the first time in a long time, I actually wanted to be alone. In that room, only I and my thoughts had motion. But this room had a mirror. As I sat and stared at myself in the lower corner of that reflective surface, I couldn't help but see the battered and scarred body I'd earned for myself by surviving this far. My temple had been drilled into; my cheek had been shot through; my arm had been broken twice; my face had been beaten and kicked to a pulp not too long ago; more and deeper pains the longer I looked. I could die, and so could the ones I loved. This was mortality. But this room had a mirror. Throughout Conrad's entire facility, deeper and deeper into the Earth, every single mirror had been removed. I was the only one that had noticed, and even then I had not really picked up on itand not until that moment. I couldn't put it into words, but, in that quiet realization, I saw the path to defeating my horrible mentor. It would take time and careful strategy, but I suddenly saw him for what he really was, and that gave me the edge. The alarm jarred me from sleep the following morning. The offensive was in motion, and the Coalition Alliance would be moving to assault Her Glory's stronghold in less than three hours. Focus on preparations took over, and I had no time for anything but a warm touch for each of the three people I loved before we donned our helmets, climbed on our new bikes, and rode out alongside tanks and supply trucks, beneath jets and helicopters, and ahead of legions of Yngtak foot soldiers that had been re-armed with the energy lances the spheres had previously taken from them. Our thousand men would not turn the tide alone, but we were armed to the teeth with freshly fabricated vehicles, guns, ammunition, and morale. Her Glory's homeworld held a nightmare landscape. Spiky growing arcs dotted dark hills under a diseased-orange and bile-yellow sky that gave us only chill winds as greeting. The very earth seemed absent; corrugated metal had grown in its place. A river of mercury ran beside us, and we avoided it with apprehension. This was a world overrun with industrial machination, and I found myself rethinking the possibility that the ancient Empress could be a person of good heart. Our way was paved with the destruction of cybernetically-enhanced animals of the kind that had exploded and killed Porcia, and mortars from nearby Vanguard positions created a constant rain of flaring light. We approached what could only be her citadel: a massive mountain encased in a globular shimmering shield whose glimmer I recognized from the skies of my youth. We presented ourselves as reinforcements at an enormous base in a highly defensible chrome valley; called Northern Point for its proximity to the enemy fortress, it would be the launching point for the nuclear-equipped jets, many of which had already taken off. More Yngtaks joined our own here, and I rode open-mouthed alongside my small family of Amber soldiers as I took in the might of the Coalition Alliance. Inverted amethyst pyramids floated overhead, while giants crafted from plant matter lumbered along the earth-bound paths. In the base with us, Noah gawked at a pale-skinned and white-haired woman in jade armor and told me, ""That's gotta be the dead woman that helped Alek Staley's people on the first Exodus!"" I was glad for my helmet, for it hid my awkward stare. She was walking around! She was expressionless and white as bone, sure, but she hardly seemed dead. If she was, it was not fair in the least. Why was it that Death had so many exceptions for everyone but me and the ones I loved? Putting that thought aside, I told Noah on a private channel, ""Alright. We're here. There's not much time. Let's find the Amber chain of command."" He replied an affirmative on the same channel. He knew that only myself, my three, and Cristina were aware of our real mission; Caecilia, Trajan, Paulinus, Larentia, and Septus would have to remain in the dark for the moment. I ached to tell Caecilia, for I trusted her capability in all things, but I had not had the opportunity to catch her alone and there was no easy way to speak privately to her now without raising suspicion. We stood next to our bikes and watched the frantic preparations until an unassuming young man in non-descript clothes passedand Noah gave a subtle nod in his direction. Cristina followed Noah and me closely while Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia maintained an inconspicuous rear guard. We tracked the young man to a tent in a rear corner of the base that was nearly out of sight behind stacks of equipment crates. Within, we could see the movement of a dozen men, and Noah indicated that all of them were from the Amber Worlds. I wasn't sure what the plan was, and I turned to consult only to find Cristina pushing right into the tent. We stepped in after her to back her up; fourteen soldiers stared at us. They had each been doing something with gear and weapons, but had stopped upon our intrusion. Hot winds surged behind us as the first nuclear strikes detonated in the unseen distance outside the tent; a great rumble shook the flat corrugated metal under our boots. The attack had begun, but it was not too late to call off the offensive. Without missing a beat, Cristina took control with the manner of a seasoned officer, but she said no such thing. Holding out her tablet device, she ordered, ""Give me the complete Vanguard roster. The full million. I want their finders after this is over."" ---

The room the four of us had chosen for training held the shape of a long and flat storage tank. Very similar to the space the Yngtaks had been held in, it could have supported our full thousand men, but it was one of dozens of such unused spaces and nothing had been inside it when we'd found it. It gave me the distinct sensation that I was inside an empty airplane hangar. Closer than those distant walls, though, my gaze bored into the upright metal plate before me. I called forth memories of those I lovedand, wrapped in those energies, gave the smooth chrome a solid punch with my gloved hand. While Celcus and Sampson stared, Flavia moved forward on her crutches to study the silvery fist-print. "" It's hot,"" she declared, pulling her finger back quickly. "" Probably from the stress on the metal itself."" She turned her head and narrowed her eyes at my undamaged knuckles. "" It's not just strength. You'd have to be more durable as well to not break your hand doing that."" It was rare that I felt this way. I was not immune to fear or anticipation, but, at that moment, I was actually *nervous.* What would they think of me? Asking them to accept that I romantically loved each of them had been harrowing enough, but now something even stranger was happening to me. Sampson clenched a fist and tensed his bicep to emphasize his thought. "" You do that by thinking of the qualities *we* possess?"" Honesty had not failed me in the caves. I decided that I needed to tell them everything now that I had told them anything. "" Well, for that punch, mostly thoughts of you."" Quickly seeing the confusion on their faces, I elaborated, ""When I need to be smart and analytical, I think of you"" I looked to Flavia. "" and when I need the self-awareness to balance more than one of these traits at once, I think of *you.*"" My tall man met my gaze with growing understanding. Celcus sank into thought. "" So you take on the strengths of those around you. Is it possible this is just a psychological effect? Maybe you can do these things because you believe you can."" Sampson gave a proud chuckle and raised a hand toward the damaged metal plate. "" You think *that's* just a product of belief?"" ""Human beings have been known to exceed their limits under extreme stress,"" Flavia mused. "" And of course we were trained to call upon those more costly layers of endurance at will. That may have helped her reach this place, but, no, this is beyond adrenaline factors. If she'd broken her hand with that punch, I'd have considered it likely, but no amount of stress can make bones and skin hardier."" My gaze kept jumping to each of them as they spoke. My fate was in their hands in a very unique and personal way. What if they chose to hate or fear me? What if
""Has anyone felt a drain during the events in question?"" Celcus asked, emerging from his deeper thoughts to look us in the eyes. "" Venita's described a handful of miracles in which she drew upon our strengths, but I don't recall feeling weakened during those moments."" Flavia froze halfway to speaking before reconsidering her words. "" I hadn't thought of that."" Looking down to spend a moment recalling, she then continued: ""I didn't feel weaker, either. ""Then that means she's not taking something from usshe's instinctively restructuring her own biology on the fly. Where would that energy come from?"" Taking a moment to study my face, she said in our formal dialectwhich we had not been able to use in quite some timea small modified phrase of wonder. The saying was normally *it is beyond belief, but my eyes prove it*; her statement was closer to, ""You are amazing."" My cheeks burned as I became acutely aware of their eyes upon me. That heat was matched only by the furnace in my heart. Desperate to shift attention away, I said, ""Energy? There's a sort of colored fire that burns in me."" Flavia took that in stride and moved closer on her crutches. "" I pointed to my heart. ""And what color?"" I wasn't sure why I found her line of questioning surprising, but I also realized that she couldn't see or feel it the way I could. "" She moved very close, as if in an attempt to see the fire through my very eyes. "" What *kind* of blue?"" Cheeks warming again due to her nearness, I gulped away a catch in my throat and offered, ""Lighter than cobalt, darker than cyan. Maybe azure to turquoise depending on intensity."" ""No hints of purple or green?"" I shook my head. She blinked, took that answer, and moved away while thinking. Celcus asked, ""Should we tell Septus? It doesn't feel right doing this without him."" ""I haven't known him as long as you,"" Sampson countered, ""But that likely makes me more objective. Anyone who listens to Conrad can't be fully trusted. This is too big. Too important."" My embarrassment at receiving personal attention faded in favor of my strategic senses. "" I think Conrad already knowsor at least suspects."" ""Yes,"" Flavia said from ten paces away while facing the empty distance of the white-lit hangar. "" He noticed you almost immediately, and his focus has only increased. I think he knew something was different about you from the moment your hand let us into his medical facility."" She turned around suddenly on her cast-clad leg. "" This has to be why your hand gets access from these places! Perhaps your biology reacts to what the system is looking for, or maybe there's some other element in you that only"" She froze. Celcus and Sampson were thinking it, but I was the one who asked, ""What?"" ""It's you,"" she breathed, staring at me. "" That thing Conrad said. The Sixth Millennial."" I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be set apart from my family. "" Flavia hobbled forward. "" What would the Machine Empress design her systems to look for in her absence if not the one thing that nobody else could replicate? A spark of some sortor a flame."" The words struck me like a hammer, and I lost all sense of where I was as I removed my glove and stared down at my own hand. I could see and feel blue fire moving along the nerves of that limb, palm, and digits; I could clench that energy and gather it up to strike, defend, or transform. It was emotionthe energy of emotion released from the mental realm and set ablaze in the physical. I still wore both my arm braces, but I doubted I needed the therapeutic one any longer. The multi-tool had become an extension of me, while the brace for my formerly broken arm had reached the end of its usefulness. There was someone else who needed it more. Carefully unclicking it and removing it, I handed the arm brace to Flavia. "" For your broken arm. Let's get that cast off."" She seemed taken aback by the gift. "" You don't need it?"" ""I don't think so. Not anymore."" ""Then forget the arm,"" she said with excitement. "" I'll use this thing on my leg so I can finally walk without crutches again."" Celcus asked, ""It can be resized like that?"" Already lifting her uniform's pant leg and cutting with her combat knife, Flavia used a term we had learned from the Vanguard: ""Duh."" We helped her remove the cast completely, and nobody mentioned the rather odious release underneath. The automatic systems inside the brace adjusted quickly to encircle, clamp, and support in the right places, and she stood with a mixed sigh. "" Hurts a little, but not with bone-pain. I think I'm just lucky it wasn't a worse break."" ""I would have given it to you sooner if I'd have thought it could be used on your leg,"" I told her, genuinely apologetic. How could I have failed to think of that? Her injuries had been sustained saving my life! My leg needed time to heal, and we've still probably put it on a little early, but I'm willing to trade some pain for mobility that might keep me alive in the coming days."" Celcus and Sampson both agreed with that, and the three of us watched as Flavia limped around the empty hangar with an exuberant smile. Raising her good arm, she aimed her pistol at the far wall a few times, testing her stance. "" I am half a warrior again."" ""Just half?"" Celcus called over with humor. ""Half an Amber soldier is more than enough."" For the next half an hour, my newly mobile beloved ran me through my paces like I was a first-year cadet, and, in some sense, I wasonly this academy was my own changing mind and body. At first, I was just happy that the people I loved accepted whatever this was, but then I, too, began sharing their excitement. Clicking her wrist-watch and comparing that number to our measurements of the hangar, she declared in Empire units in case Vanguard soldiers overhead us: ""Twenty one point one kilometers per hour. Not bad, but clearly a normal speed for a fit female our age. You weren't the fastest of us, either."" She readied her watch again. "" This time, think of Porcia. I set off around the lap we had demarcated with my thoughts focused on the fleetest of our family. She was gone, but her essence remained in my memories, and I could feel Septus' love for her keeping her with us as well. Celcus shouted; Sampson clapped once in surprise. I ignored their reactions in favor of reliving the adrenaline of the run I'd made against Conradand the lap was over before I could even really register beyond that. Flavia lowered her wrist-watch. "" Panting, I asked, ""What was the speed?"" She answered slowly, as if haunted. "" You didn't run the whole lap."" ""Of course I did."" I gasped for air as I regarded the course. "" I took each corner."" I took cues from my beloved men. "" Celcus and Sampson saw me run the whole thing."" Flavia accepted their nods, but still shook her head. "" You did go fast. Nearly double. I'd guess thirty-five to thirty-seven kilometers per hour. Amazing speed matching some of the best Amber sprintersmale ones, in fact. But *you didn't run the whole lap.*"" Confused and increasingly unhappy, I could only tell her, ""I don't understand what you mean."" She didn't seem to be able to blink. Her blue eyes remained on me; glinting moisture brimmed. "" I don't understand either, but you've done it once before."" ""Come on now,"" Celcus said, stepping between and breaking our line of sight. "" I saw her take each corner. How could she have turned four times but not run the whole lap?"" She gripped her forehead and turned away. "" I think maybe I'm just tired. I'm going to go rest in my room."" As I recovered my breath and watched her leave, I realized that I had seen through her eyes before and thus had some idea what was bothering her. She saw the world in a flurry of connections; a spider web of logistical axes bound by colored sums of a thousand hues and countless possible moments refracted like light through a prism made of time. She had never told anyone this, though I'd somehow drawn that aspect of her to me and seen through eyes tinted with her perspective when I'd raced Conradbut I myself had been the one thing I had not been able to observe. What had she seen in me with her unique vision that had disturbed her so? ""Yeah, time for a break,"" Sampson said, heading off as well. Only Celcus and I were left, and he asked as casually as he could, ""You and Sampson have fun last night?"" Snapped out of one frame and into another, I immediately replied, ""Yes,"" before thinking better of it. "" Well, we went for a walk. Does that... bother you?"" He tried to smile, but his answer was serious. "" I just hope you realize you're going to have to make some decisions soon. Let us know what you feel so that we don't have the wrong expectations."" What *did* I feel? I'd just taken off my arm brace, and that gave me the words. "" To deny any of you would be like cutting off one of my limbs. I can't do it."" His awkward shrugging and the masked pain on his face nearly broke my heart. He asked, ""Do you still feel the same about me?"" I did my best to convey everything I felt for him through an upwardly aimed kiss; my tall man had needed that, and he left with a lighter and reassured step. He was not wrong. I knew that I would have to do something soon. I'd been hoping the coming battle would delay personal decisions, but it was our instructors had told us: life doesn't stop for war. On my own journey through the halls, I remained quiet and brooding, but I could certainly feel the wordless attention of passersby. Human and Yngtak alike had seen me involved with the impossible, and I suspected Conrad might have been preaching something about me. Worse, I had no makeup to dull my appearance like I usually did back home, and I felt rather naked. One of the unpaired Vanguard men tried to stop and talk to me with a grin, but I made a polite excuse and practically ran away. Why did people have to look at other people that way? I just wanted to be an unremarkable part of a group. That way
That way I would never be alone. If I never took a personal risk, I would never risk losing the group, and I would never have to feel like I had felt *back then*. My feet no longer took me forward. Frozen in the middle of the hallway, I became aware of a fear that had likely been holding me back my entire life. I had not known myself. I had not had personal courage. I had not had the support and love I'd neededuntil now. My grandfather was a wonderful man, but he had not been able to fill the roles of an entire family. Now I had siblings in Trajan, Larentia, Paulinus, and Septus; an older sister in Caecilia; beloveds in Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia; a friend in Noah; andstrangest of all for me to recognizetwo crucial figures that fulfilled two very different but highly linked roles. Conrad approached down the hall as I stood waiting; he waved off his three lieutenants and they continued on, leaving us alone. He stood in silence, intrigued, until finally asking, ""Patience is not one of my virtues. Out with it girl."" As strange as it felt to consider this man as a partial filler of the missing role of father in my life, I had to say it: ""You've been trying to push me to improve, haven't you?"" His flat lips curved into a smile. "" I'll admit that, yes."" So it was true. I felt numb as I probed further. "" His head had gone from military near-baldness to hosting a short layer of brown hair in the time that I had known him; he ran his hand once through this now as he considered me with an only mildly unkind snicker. "" Do you think it's coincidence that the Sixth Millennial walked up to my door in humanity's hour of greatest need? Me, the one man above all others who knew the Fifth inside and out?"" So that, too, was true. I took a moment to breathe and guess at all the things I did not know because I had been raised not to ask questions. Darkness and light both had been glimmering outside the narrow purview of my personal concerns. How *dark?* "" Tell me all this isn't just to challenge me."" ""Not all of it, no,"" he said wryly at first; his smirk abruptly fell into dead seriousness. "" But I did send the signal to resurrect my wife because of you."" Cristina's desperate *why now?* echoed in my ears, and I took a step back. "" You""
""I suspected you from the very beginning,"" he continued. "" But I knew for certain when you helped me lift that door and free the Yngtaks. Not only did the energy you released heat the entire hallway full of water, I swam back there after and found your handprints on the bottom of the door. The outline of your fingers in *solid metal.*"" I couldn't deny it to him or to myself, not after what I'd done in secret only an hour before. The agenda behind this, though, had to be darker than I could imagine. "" You'd wake the monster behind the spheres just to spite me?"" He shook his head sadly. "" Look around you, Venita. These facilities were built to hold thousands, or even tens of thousands, not one woman. While I lost myself in dreams and nightmares, merciless boredom and hollow wonder eternal, Gisela built an entire empire for a people that exiled her long ago. More than that, she developed the technology for resurrectionDeath defeated! Truly slain!but then set the system not to bring her back unless I desired it, unless I came out of my eon of ennui and wanted to see her again. This was always a woman, not of evil, but of strong emotion. Whatever she may have become over centuries of solitude, she will never be a monster, just a worthy opponent."" The facilities. They'd been built so absurdly large. I'd never understood it. I'd wandered the floors, explored their labyrinthine depths, and marveled at the redundancy. I didn't trust Conrad, but I trusted that assessment of these factories and hospitals. They'd been built all over the region for capacity far beyond the needs of one lonely exiled Empress. "" But we're set to attack her main fortress."" He nodded carefully. "" We've been sending teams ahead with vehicles, supplies, and pallets of gear. They still can't come back until we win the day, but they *can* stock the million soldiers already laying siege. I've told them to spread the word that The Machine Empress of Mankind is about to resurrect."" A shiver of confusion ran through me. "" Have I misread you? Have you done all this with good intent?"" ""You misunderstand."" His smile became subtly mocking. "" They'll take it as an urgent omen of doom, not as a relief that this will all be over when she wakes up and turns off the artificial intelligence defense forces. They're making a grave error at my behest, and they'll deeply regret what happens after."" I stepped away with abject horror. Conrad's smile deepened as the full weight of what was happening hit me. We'd made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost had been our inevitably coming across and waking our immortal Imperator. My world had made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost would be a war with what the others had called a force on level with a god. The Fifth Millennial, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind, would easily destroy our Amber Worlds if so enraged. We'd been barely surviving trips across small portions of her realm. What could possibly stand against her in outright war? ""Yes,"" he said quietly as passersby approached. "" Things are going to be very hard for you shortly, but I think you'll rise to the task. If not, at least the battles will be entertaining as hell."" Acknowledging the passing soldiers, he nodded and headed away, completely unperturbed by our conversation. Don't panic. If my father figure was a manipulating bastard, then I needed his opposite. Bursting into her room after a mad dash, I shouted, ""Cristina!"" She looked up from her handheld tablet device. "" What's wrong?"" Hitting the button to slide the door closed behind me, I told her everythingthe testing, my discoveries, Conrad's tauntingand she listened and nodded along, unsurprised at any of it. "" Sit down, Venita."" I had never had the spotlight so directly focused on me by the course of events before, but my panic began to fade as I sat on the floor next to the bed and she began braiding my hair like she had that day at the river. ""Conrad told you what he told you for a reason,"" she told me with calm focus as she layered my hair back and forth behind my head. "" He's being both honest *and* manipulative. That's what makes his moves so effective. If he was lying, we could just find the truth, or even ignore himbut I have no doubt he believes what he's told you. Furthermore, he's calculated that revealing his intentions furthers his goals. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said anything."" Taking a deep breath and focusing my sight on the opposite metal wall, I asked, ""So he wanted me panicked? Wanted me distracted?"" ""I don't think so. It sounds like he's purposely given you fair warning. He wants you to grow stronger and face off against the Machine Empress. We can only speculate as to why, but, for the moment, our agendas align. We should work on getting you stronger."" She tugged down a few times before resuming. "" In the meantime, our mission will be to insert ourselves in the chain of command at the siege. * Somebody* from the Amber Worlds is in charge, despite the million men at large not publicly knowing."" ""Noah can sense Amber people,"" I told her. "" Or, rather, he *can't*, so he can pick them out of a crowd."" That's perfect. When the offensive begins, we'll join the tide, but we'll move to find the Amber soldiers and lie our way into the chain of command. After all, you *are* from Amber Three, and we'll know so much they'll have no choice but to believe us. The inability to get home means they won't be able to confirm with their headquarters any more than we will. Then we'll call off the attack."" All the terror that Conrad had instilled in me was gone. It was a solid plan. "" It might actually work."" ""It will."" She began working the longer ends of my braid. "" Right now, it sounds like you've got other things to worry about. Romantically, I only ever loved one person. Saw him in those Kansan wheat fields in his soldiering gear and decided he was it. But you've got yourself into a very tough situation. A team can't go into battle with confusion or pain between its members. And who knows who'll be part of the coming twenty percent? You have to live and love while you can."" She stopped just short of finishing my braid, and I guessed she was thinking of her lost husband. ""They calculated a twenty percent loss rate for the offensive?"" I asked, turning my head to the side to look up at her. ""No,"" she murmured. "" Twenty percent survival rate."" For the second time that day, true dread snaked its way around my heart. "" Twenty percent? * One in five?*"" There were five of us left in my squad! What if I was the only one who lived? What if all the
She snapped back to awareness and tied the end of my braid, finishing it. "" Don't let it get to you. It's just an estimate based on an incomplete model. We'll survive. We're not going to bear the brunt of those losses, remember? Our mission is orthogonal. And I would never send you into a murderous slugfest like that. The day is never won solely because of guns."" ""They sure help, though."" Pushing the dark snake away from my heart thanks to her calm confidence, I frowned. "" How do I choose?"" She let me up, and stood to walk me out. "" That's up to you. Nobody else can tell you how to live."" After activating the door and peering left and right, she told me, ""It's clear. Nobody saw you. I'm concerned he may have provoked you into running straight to the leader of the secret opposition faction, but, if you did have a tail, you lost them."" That brought a smile back to my face. "" I do run pretty fast these days."" She pushed me on my way. "" And don't worry. We'll survive what's coming."" I made it decently far away from her quarters before anyone saw me; meanwhile, I became preoccupied with the choice ahead. How could I possibly refuse what I felt for any of my three beloveds? Was it as simple as choosing the one whose potential loss most terrified me? That seemed like an odd thought in many ways. Something vital would be cut from me if I lost any of my threebut something vital would be cut from *them* if I remained vague and indecisive. While wandering the halls, I heard the words: ""It's better than *nothing!*"" I was walking along the second floor subsection C toward Sampson's quarters when a prickling along my skin stopped me in place. Without any other warning, two bloodied men in unrecognizable clothes fought hand-to-hand past the T-junction ahead. Shouting and punching one another, they were definitely engaged in a real and vicious fight. I only got a good look at oneand even then I saw only black hair and fierce eyesbut I absolutely heard him yell, ""The way *you* run things maybe!"" The two combatants moved beyond the end of the hall and out of sight. Dashing forward, I looked left and right down the junction, but they were nowhere to be seen. Had they fought around a corner or into one of the nearby rooms? I heard nothing, and the hallway was silent. To quote my Vanguard friend Sol: what *the hell* had that been? The hair on the back of my neck remained charged as I stood in that silent hall. I had the distinct impression of water flowing back into a hole and sealing it up; or of a plane flying over, full of lives that were crossing close by but which would never interact with mine. ""Venita,"" someone called, and I turned to see a doctor I recognized approaching. "" Did I hear right that you and your friends cut off Flavia's leg cast?"" Is everything alright?"" He came close and gave me a strange look. "" You know people don't normally do that kind of thing themselves. They usually get a doctor."" Some of his past comments and suspicions came back to me, and I had the sudden notion that he was somewhat cognizant of our differences from the rest of the Vanguard. "" Oh, um, we didn't want to bother you."" ""Is that so."" He took in a long draw of breath through his nose and let it out over the course of several seconds. "" Well, bother me in the future. It's why I'm here."" ""Of course. Thank you."" I watched him head on further down the hall before I resumed my course. Rather than head to Sampson's room, I chose my own, and I closed the door to find myself in rare solitude I had not experienced since that night at Conrad's medical facility. This factory had rooms for thousands of people, and thankfully so, for the Yngtaks alone took up two entire floors. I was tired of walking the crowded halls and running afoul of others. For the first time in a long time, I actually wanted to be alone. In that room, only I and my thoughts had motion. But this room had a mirror. As I sat and stared at myself in the lower corner of that reflective surface, I couldn't help but see the battered and scarred body I'd earned for myself by surviving this far. My temple had been drilled into; my cheek had been shot through; my arm had been broken twice; my face had been beaten and kicked to a pulp not too long ago; more and deeper pains the longer I looked. I could die, and so could the ones I loved. This was mortality. But this room had a mirror. Throughout Conrad's entire facility, deeper and deeper into the Earth, every single mirror had been removed. I was the only one that had noticed, and even then I had not really picked up on itand not until that moment. I couldn't put it into words, but, in that quiet realization, I saw the path to defeating my horrible mentor. It would take time and careful strategy, but I suddenly saw him for what he really was, and that gave me the edge. The alarm jarred me from sleep the following morning. The offensive was in motion, and the Coalition Alliance would be moving to assault Her Glory's stronghold in less than three hours. Focus on preparations took over, and I had no time for anything but a warm touch for each of the three people I loved before we donned our helmets, climbed on our new bikes, and rode out alongside tanks and supply trucks, beneath jets and helicopters, and ahead of legions of Yngtak foot soldiers that had been re-armed with the energy lances the spheres had previously taken from them. Our thousand men would not turn the tide alone, but we were armed to the teeth with freshly fabricated vehicles, guns, ammunition, and morale. Her Glory's homeworld held a nightmare landscape. Spiky growing arcs dotted dark hills under a diseased-orange and bile-yellow sky that gave us only chill winds as greeting. The very earth seemed absent; corrugated metal had grown in its place. A river of mercury ran beside us, and we avoided it with apprehension. This was a world overrun with industrial machination, and I found myself rethinking the possibility that the ancient Empress could be a person of good heart. Our way was paved with the destruction of cybernetically-enhanced animals of the kind that had exploded and killed Porcia, and mortars from nearby Vanguard positions created a constant rain of flaring light. We approached what could only be her citadel: a massive mountain encased in a globular shimmering shield whose glimmer I recognized from the skies of my youth. We presented ourselves as reinforcements at an enormous base in a highly defensible chrome valley; called Northern Point for its proximity to the enemy fortress, it would be the launching point for the nuclear-equipped jets, many of which had already taken off. More Yngtaks joined our own here, and I rode open-mouthed alongside my small family of Amber soldiers as I took in the might of the Coalition Alliance. Inverted amethyst pyramids floated overhead, while giants crafted from plant matter lumbered along the earth-bound paths. In the base with us, Noah gawked at a pale-skinned and white-haired woman in jade armor and told me, ""That's gotta be the dead woman that helped Alek Staley's people on the first Exodus!"" I was glad for my helmet, for it hid my awkward stare. She was walking around! She was expressionless and white as bone, sure, but she hardly seemed dead. If she was, it was not fair in the least. Why was it that Death had so many exceptions for everyone but me and the ones I loved? Putting that thought aside, I told Noah on a private channel, ""Alright. We're here. There's not much time. Let's find the Amber chain of command."" He replied an affirmative on the same channel. He knew that only myself, my three, and Cristina were aware of our real mission; Caecilia, Trajan, Paulinus, Larentia, and Septus would have to remain in the dark for the moment. I ached to tell Caecilia, for I trusted her capability in all things, but I had not had the opportunity to catch her alone and there was no easy way to speak privately to her now without raising suspicion. We stood next to our bikes and watched the frantic preparations until an unassuming young man in non-descript clothes passedand Noah gave a subtle nod in his direction. Cristina followed Noah and me closely while Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia maintained an inconspicuous rear guard. We tracked the young man to a tent in a rear corner of the base that was nearly out of sight behind stacks of equipment crates. Within, we could see the movement of a dozen men, and Noah indicated that all of them were from the Amber Worlds. I wasn't sure what the plan was, and I turned to consult only to find Cristina pushing right into the tent. We stepped in after her to back her up; fourteen soldiers stared at us. They had each been doing something with gear and weapons, but had stopped upon our intrusion. Hot winds surged behind us as the first nuclear strikes detonated in the unseen distance outside the tent; a great rumble shook the flat corrugated metal under our boots. The attack had begun, but it was not too late to call off the offensive. Without missing a beat, Cristina took control with the manner of a seasoned officer, but she said no such thing. Holding out her tablet device, she ordered, ""Give me the complete Vanguard roster. The full million. I want their finders after this is over."" ---

When I moved all of our stuff out of our house there wasn't a door frame or drawer or cabinet unbroken from her rage over the most selfish of insignificant injustices(she felt) were being perpetrated on her. It's taken me 8 months to try to understand the disorder(s) and her childhood trauma and WHY she is the way she CHOOSES TO BE. Make no mistake...they have the ability to restrain themselves. They don't respect anyone enough to do it because they feel everyone is either doing them wrong, will do them wrong, or the scariest thing of all...will make them vulnerable by loving them like I did. Their fear of abandonment runs unusually deep, yet it's EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO TO THE PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEM. I can't paint a picture of how much I cherished her. I tried my best to make sure she never had a necessity ever run dry. One way or another, no matter the risk or sacrifice, I NEVER let her go without. My mother was agitated with the way I ""babied"" her. To me it was just how I felt about her. I cherished her. Just like any narcissistic/codependent relationship though, the bar would be raised so she could justify the devaluing as her BPD and Bipolar would have her splitting and idealizing the ""doormat parachute"". Her learning disabled, mentally challenged ex husband who's barely literate and hasn't matured intellectually beyond high school. He'll allow her to run back, use him for resources, cheat on him and break his heart, all while the kids watch. It's a repeat record left on play that she somehow thinks will play a different song with each restart of the needle. They aren't just mentally ill. They're spiritually ill. I actually died on my second suicide attempt after I was hospitalized for stress induced cardiomyopathy(second one...the first was after her previous discard which she swore on the lives of her children she'd never do again) and had an extremely profound NDE. I was given the chance to stay in the most indescribable and infinite loving light you could ever imagine, OR...From what I was shown and have literally seen playing out like clips of a movie film...come back to try and redirect her from destroying everyone that loves her, and in tbe end, herself. I made a MASSIVE mistake. After her psychotic break in January where I feel was really a spiritual battle she lost to something very dark, who came out is void of any of the good she had in her. 7 years...engaged to be married last Spring...and she just ghosted me with no explanation. No closure. I'm a living corpse of constant suicidal ideation and excruciating heartbreak. I've tried every type of therapy, multiple mood stabilizers and other prescriptions...even street drugs to attempt to numb me and it's all in vain. What she did to me...The man that ""Loves her like a fairytale"" as she used to say...is the cruelest thing I've ever seen a person do to someone that loves them. For her to walk away from it without a scratch is a massive slap in the face, and I have no fear of death. The closest connection to the creator and the teacher Jesus Christ I was made unwaveringly aware and faithful in that perhaps the only thing that might snap her out of it is the public knowledge that she killed me. The guy every girl saw with her and slapped their SO telling them to be more like...I've literally not stopped crying for 8 months. I'm NOT going g back to inpatient to have my grief treated as the emotions of a child and be talked to like a developmentally disabled child. Honestly...I'm already dead anyways. I keep this typed up to show people how a narcissist or any other Cluster B can destroy you if you fall in love with one: After almost 7 years of believing I was just too defective to love the soul mate"" or ""Twin Flame"" God gave me and that's why she discarded me every 2 years, I found out what it""(Narcissistic Abuse) wastoo late. Since my 3rd discard in the relationship(you can call it splitting if you prefer, it doesn't change the pain it causes though) by the person I'd do anything for and love more than life itself in February after she had a psychotic break and obviously lost part of her soul, I am now in psychotherapy 2 to 3 days a week. I'm recovering from my SECOND stress induced cardiomyopathy in the relationship with the person I love most in this world from the heartbreak. It's a type of heart attack brought in by sudden severe emotional trauma. My heart is probably malformed for life. I'm still at risk for cardiac arrest. I have NAS(NarcissisticAbuseSyndrome), severe depression with CONSTANT suicidal ideation...I've attempted suicide 4 times, actually being successful on the second but lived ultimately, and that's where I had a near/post death experience that will shape the rest of my life, for however long that may be. I'm now diagnosed with CPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder as well. I lost 44 lbs in 4 months. People with BPD are VERY COMMONLY misdiagnosed and treated(with catastrophic consequences) as ""Bipolar"". HIGHLY narcissistic traits and the pattern of narcissistic abuse in their Unstable relationships is also not uncommon. You might be dealing with ANY...OR MORE THAN ONE...Cluster B Personality Disorders in these people who inflict this kind of abuse on the people who love them most. Her response to learning of my second suicide attempt was that she's the happiest she's been in YEARS. Whether it's the depression and heartbreak that kills me or the actual damage to my PHYSICAL HEART makes little difference to me. The fact remains that the person I have loved and adored more than anyone in my lifetime has ZERO empathy, compassion, or remorse after nearly 7 years together. I was thrown away in the blink of an eye like an old gum wrapper on the floorboard of a used car, with no explanation at all...let alone closure. I'm a pretty tough guy. Played hockey for 9 years. I've taken a 7.62X39 through the shin and out my calf and kept moving. I've broken a femur, had my lower row of teeth knocked out in a hockey game and kept playing the game b4 going to the hospital...had my sciatic nerve nearly severed...and never shed a tear. I have cried from the moment I opened up my eyes in the morning until I go to sleep for 7 months. Nothing is helping. I honestly cant live like this.. Whether it's ""BPD SPLITTING"" or ""NARCISSISTIC DISCARDING"" doesn't change the impact it has on a person who did nothing more than commit the awful crime of loving them. I'm LITERALLY just another a living corpse under her feet. All for the crime of Loving her like a fairytale. Her words, not mine.","I have NAS(NarcissisticAbuseSyndrome), severe depression with CONSTANT suicidal ideation...I've attempted suicide 4 times, actually being successful on the second but lived ultimately, and that's where I had a near/post death experience that will shape the rest of my life, for however long that may be.",4651,8,1

With my teacher I have been working through the christopher parkening method books (still on volume 1). We have splashed in some other material (some chord work with folk music). I've been practicing about an hour to 1.5 hours a day. In addition, over the past month and change I have been mussing around with a strat that a friend is letting me long-term-borrow along with an application called rocksmith - usually another hour to another hour and a half a day. However, I seem to be hitting a pretty heavy wall. My teacher had been assigning 3-4 pieces a week, though that has slowed down. Reading reviews, apparently one of the big criticisms of the Parkening books is that they have a HUGE ramp up in difficulty. I am up to about exercise 60 (Beethoven's 5th) and I'm finding that I just can't keep up. Working on that one piece all week, playing extremely slow (15 bpm-30bpm), and I'm only about half way through. My fingers just can't seem to find the right spots on the fretboard and it doesn't seem to be sticking mentally.

It took a little finagling to find the right dosage, but I have not experienced any weight gain as a result of it (i did gain weight due to a traumatic pregnancy, but that wasnt the Lexapro's fault). As for sex -- my libido went up once on it bc I cant fuck if I'm all anxious and having panic attacks. Some folk say they feel numb on them. For me, that only happens if the dose is too high. For a few of my friends, they needed to try a few different SSRIs to get one that worked for them. Full disclosure, I did experience a few side effects when I first started: weird ass dreams, insomnia, a headache, and I felt a little tipsy. They all went away within a week. After pregnancy, I developed pmdd amd now I up and lower my dosage according to my cycle. If I miscalculate and take too high a dose, I will be a little numb but it only lasts 24 hrs. And occasionally I get the weird dreams and insomnia when I come down again. But they only last a day or so. That's something to keep in mind -- it's out of your system very quickly. So, if you dont like it, you can get off it without much difficulty. They say it can take up to a month to feel the full effect, but I noticed it within a week.

s_2815_1699,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Teeny-Tiny My doctors asked me to tell my story so other girls like me could read it and learn from my mistakes because Ill be dead soon. That makes me pretty sad to think about. I dont want other girls to be sick like I am. I guess they wont be sick exactly like me, because that would be crazy, but maybe they can read this so they wont make the bad decisions I made. When I was little, Mom used to hold me and say stuff like, Oh Katie, you fit so perfectly on my lap! Youre so teeny-tiny! I loved it. Shed keep me warm and hug me and I felt so great. Id always go to Mom if I felt sad or scared and shed just scoop me up, saying whats wrong, my teeny-tiny girl? and Id tell her what was making me upset and shed always always always make it all better. The most vivid memory I have was the day I turned 10. It wasnt of my party, which I vaguely remember being great, it wasnt the presents, some of which I still have, but it was when Mom had me in her lap that night and had tears in her eyes and said to Dad, Katies getting to be a big girl, huh? I dont remember what my dad said, but there was no denying it: I wasnt her teeny-tiny girl anymore. At 10 years old, I was about 410, maybe 100 pounds. I was growing fast. Both my parents are tall. I remember being scared. The scale kept going up, and by the time I was 11 I was 52, 120 pounds and I started getting boobs. At that point, when I was sad, mom would hug me tight and say the right things, but it all felt different. She never cradled me. She never had me in her lap. I felt cold and lonely even though I was never really cold or lonely. I just wanted to be closer to her like I was when I was little. So I decided to get little again. Mom started to notice when I pushed around my food on the plate, trying to pile it up on one side to make it look like I ate more than I really did. Youre a growing girl, she said, kindly but firmly. You need to eat. I couldnt leave the table until I was done. That night after dinner, I remember lying on my back on the bed, staring at the ceiling and feeling the food in my stomach. Moms words youre a growing girl echoed in my mind and I felt so sick that I ran into the bathroom and threw up. I was really glad I had my own bathroom so they couldnt hear me puking. After I was done, I felt so much better. Lighter and smaller, even. Mom was so happy to see me eating normally again. She had worried aloud that I might be getting the flu, so seeing me chowing down like my old self pushed those worries right out of her head. What she didnt see was how I went to bed afterward and while the bathwater ran I was throwing it all up. I did this every day for years. One of the sad truths about throwing up your meals is that you dont lose all that much weight. I actually gained more. Sure, Id get rid of what Id eaten, but probably twice a week Id be lying in bed, wide awake, fingering my collar bones, hip bones, and ribs, and obsessing over food. Something inside me would snap, and Id run to the fridge or the cabinets and eat until I felt like I was bursting. Then, exhausted, Id go back upstairs and pass out on my bed. Calorie-for-calorie, after those twice-weekly binges I was eating more than I would if I was healthy. Except I really, really wasnt healthy. And nobody knew. All this built up to the last few months after I graduated high school. I was 511, 175lbs. 17 years old. There was absolutely nothing I hated more than my body. I was constantly lonely and wanted to try to take my mind off it all. I decided to get a job. When I told Mom I found a position at a place that recycles old medical gear, she was really proud of me for taking the initiative. It was bittersweet; I knew she was starting to see me as an adult. Not her teeny-tiny girl. I felt like a complete and utter failure. The recycling place where I worked dismantled big machines that hospitals used and sold the parts. I was the receptionist. I took phone calls and helped set up deliveries. The people I worked with were really nice and after a few weeks they gave me a key so I could get there early and have their coffee ready and their work orders printed out. That night, after everyone had left, I went back there and let myself in. I still feel bad about breaking their trust. A couple days earlier my coworkers were bringing in an old machine. They all were wearing heavy gloves and had on breathing gear like scuba divers. When they were done, I asked what it was. Apparently it was something hospitals use to give radiation therapy to cancer patients. I didnt know too much about that, so when I got home I went on Wikipedia and did a lot of research and then I got my idea. When I let myself in that night, the place was empty. I made a beeline for where they had that radiation therapy machine and I investigated it. Most of it was completely dismantled. What I was looking for was conveniently labeled and brightly marked in a massive lead container. It took me a while to get the cover off. Leads so heavy! But after I did, I saw a round metal part that looked like a wheel. I picked it up, rotated the mechanism, and it opened a little window in the front. A faint blue light was inside. I held it up to my eye and looked in. Nothing but that light. I thought it was probably what I was looking for. I brought the object home with me and locked the door of my bedroom. I worked to pry the thing open with a screwdriver but it seemed locked from the inside. Eventually I got frustrated and I turned the wheel again to open the window and pushed my screwdriver into the blue light stuff and tried scooping it out. It turned out to be pretty soft. A lot of it broke as I poked it with the screwdriver, and when I turned the wheel upside down, it tumbled out onto my desk. Now I could see how pretty it was. It was like chunks of glowing blue clay and sand. I gathered it up as best I could and put it away, save for the little bit I was going to use tonight. One of the things Id read about radiation therapy was that it made the poor people with cancer really skinny. They just totally lost their appetites. I couldnt believe it was true. Id always had such a big appetite. I kept telling myself that I need to be really careful when I take this stuff because if I get too much of the radiation I could get cancer myself. I took a pinch of the blue stuff, put it in my mouth, and swallowed it with a gulp of water. It felt warm going down even though the water was cold. Since Id gotten home from the recycling place Id been pretty warm, in fact. Like a little puppy under a blanket. That night I woke up sweating worse than Id ever sweated in my life. The bed was totally soaked. I figured weight loss was weight loss. Water weight wasnt really what I wanted, but it was better than nothing. I took a shower and changed the sheets and went back to bed. My stomach ached a little. When I woke up the next morning, my stomach hurt and I threw up a couple times. But, I wasnt even remotely hungry. That alone made the pain in my tummy pretty much go away. I didnt need to eat! Mom asked if I was bringing leftovers to work from last nights dinner and I lied and said we were going to get a pizza. I hate lying to Mom, but I didnt want her to worry. There was no need to tell her I wasnt hungry. At work, theyd finished disassembling the machine and started sending it out to wherever they send those things. Id been really careful to put the canister back exactly as I left it. No one checked to see if the little wheel was still there. The next few days were uneventful, aside from my stomach ache getting worse and having to puke once or twice. Id barely eaten anything since I started taking the radiation medicine. Whenever I got woozy from lack of food I ate an apple or a fat-free yogurt and I was fine. I was still sweating a lot. When I got on the scale, it said 168. After a week of eating nearly nothing and faithfully taking my radiation medicine nightly, my stomach ache got really, really bad. Id stopped throwing up, but this time it felt like I needed to go to the bathroom. I went, and it was awful. There was so much - I was shocked. Id apparently eaten and kept down more than I thought. It was agony coming out, too. I got on the scale after, though, and that helped me feel a lot better. Over the next couple days, one or two people told me how pretty I looked. They asked me if I lost weight and I said yeah, maybe a few pounds. Over my whole adolescence Id done nothing but get bigger. Now, finally, I was shrinking and on the way to teeny-tiny. I didnt feel too great, though. My tummy was constantly having me run to the bathroom and it still hurt afterwards. I figured I was getting rid of all the extra fat. I was in the shower about 10 days after I started taking the medicine and I was horrified to see some of my hair coming out. That was bad. Really, really, really bad. I stopped washing it immediately and let just the water rinse away the remainder of the shampoo. I got out of the shower and took like an hour blow drying my hair because I was too scared to use a towel that might pull more out. When the mirror was unfogged and my hair was dry, I checked to see how noticeable it was. There was a good-sized patch of bare, red scalp about 2 wide above my left ear. I pushed the hair around it down to cover the patch. Some more fell out. It had to be a nutritional deficiency from all the meals Id been missing. I put on my Titans hat and got dressed. When I brushed my teeth I noticed a little blood in the sink. I made a note to get some multivitamins after work. I didnt shower the next day because when I woke up that morning, there was more hair on my pillow. My scalp was getting pretty visible. It looked prickly and raw but it didnt hurt. Since I was off work I stayed at home and looked online for all the nutritional deficiencies that might cause my hair to fall out and my gums to bleed. Most of the ones were covered by my multivitamin, so I tripled the amount I took just to be on the safe side. I had to go to the bathroom five times during the 15 hours I was awake. By the last time I was incredibly light-headed and so thirsty. I weighed myself before I started downing water and my radiation medicine. The medicine had helped me lose 25 pounds in less than two weeks. Mom hugged me the next morning before I went to work. She ran her hands up and down my back and she remarked about how skinny Id gotten. Then, she said it: remember when I used to call you my teeny-tiny girl? I miss those days but I love you just as much as a grown up. Then she let me go. Pain, nausea, and despair washed over me. All of a sudden, my lightheadedness came back with a vengeance and I stumbled and fell on the kitchen floor. My hat fell off. With my head spinning, I vaguely remember Mom gasping, Katie what happened to your hair?! before I violently threw up on the floor and myself. It was all blood. I passed out to the sound of Mom screaming. I dont know how much time went by at the hospital. I wasnt completely unconscious, but all I remember up until recently when they used drugs to wake me up were images of doctors in the same scuba gear as the guys at work and saying weird words like caesium chloride and sloughed and gray that didnt mean the color. Today, I cant move or talk and Im writing this using a cool keyboard that can pick out letters using the movements of my remaining eye. Like I said in the beginning, Ill be dead soon. Im not too fun to look at anymore. My hairs gone. And my lower jaw. And my skin. The nice doctors are giving me medication that helps me manage the pain and keep me alert. They asked if they could do tests and experiments on me to help understand what ingestion of the radiation medicine does to the human body. Apparently there was a man in Japan a few years ago named Hiroshi Ouchi who got a similar level of exposure and the same stuff happened to him. They said it would help other people in the future if they could compare our two cases. Of course I let them. I cant eat food anymore. My esophagus got cooked away. Same with my stomach. The doctors are keeping me hydrated with a tube in my butt. I dont really like to think about it. I guess all the excitement I get as I wait here is when they weigh me every six hours to see if Im able to retain the fluids they give me or if it all seeps out into the sheets. They hoist me onto a pad and a little machine voice says a number. This morning it said 72. The next time it was 69. Mom and Dad have to wear those scuba suits when they come visit. Moms always crying because shes not allowed to touch me. Dad just stares. Right before I started writing this, Mom bent down and started whispering to me some of the stuff I remember her saying when I was small. I closed my eye and imagined being warm and safe on her lap. I love you, my teeny-tiny girl, she sobbed. I would have smiled if I had a mouth.",I felt like a complete and utter failure.,3764,6,1

Okay, I'm about to go into far too much detail, so get comfortable if you plan on reading all of this. I love football, I love playing Madden, I love winning, and I ***hate*** losing. Here's how much I hate losing:
My favorite player in the NFL is Tom Brady. His win/loss percentage in the NFL is roughly 78%, which is the highest of all time. When I play online, I keep track of my record to an obsessive extent. Right now it stands at 57-40, which is just below 60%. It disgusts me just to look at it. I constantly calculate how many games I'd have to win in my next 10, or 20, or 50 matches to get to 70%, then to somewhere in the high 70s. Because if I don't match Tom Brady's win percentage, I feel like a failure at the game, so every single loss sucks a LOT more than it normally would. ""You feel like a failure at the game? Dude, that's cool, don't sweat it-- it's just a game."" My brain doesn't believe that. I take this game far more seriously than I should. Feeling like a failure at the game makes me feel like a failure at life, because of what you may have already guessed is a superiority complex. And to be honest, it's not the fact that I'm obsessed with the game as a whole, it's that I'm playing another human, and I'm obsessed with being better than *everyone* who challenges me at anything. I *have* to win at everything, I have to win handily, and I have to win often. In this case, I have to be as good at this game as Tom Brady is in real life, because, ostensibly, I know that achieving the win percentage he's reached in his career is possible. Extremely difficult, but possible-- and I take pride in accomplishing the improbable. Is the extent to which I take this game seriously a problem? Do I know how to fix it? ...","Feeling like a failure at the game makes me feel like a failure at life, because of what you may have already guessed is a superiority complex.",1067,6,1

s_1692_39,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,"Tap tap tap tap tap-tap-tap About a month ago, I broke one of the hinges off the cupboard above my computer at work. Since then, the door wont shut all the way. I called maintenance to fix it, but they warned me they had a massive backlog of calls and wouldn't be able to get to me any time soon. Sure, seeing the door perpetually ajar was annoying, but I thought it best to leave the work to the professionals. The last thing I wanted was another citation from the workers union for overstepping my bounds. Last time I had the nerve to fix a loose screw on my chair, they lost their shit. As long as it didn't threaten to fall on my head, I figured there wasn't any harm in waiting. It wasn't until my colleague went on vacation last week that I realized I was wrong. There was something in my cupboard that only came out when I was alone. Having an office to oneself is probably every cubicle farmers dream. Privacy, space, and silence are things most people covet at work. Not me, though. In spite of being very high on the introvert scale, I have a need to be around people. I dont want to talk to or interact with them, mind you, but I find comfort in knowing others are around me. I also find it easier to concentrate when I *have* to make an effort to zone people out. Otherwise, I get distracted by ambient noise. Id only been alone in my office for a day, and already, I was feeling lonely. It wasn't just that the person sharing an office with me was gone, it was that almost everyone was away on vacation. I couldn't even hear people chatting about their weekend in the hallway, like they normally did. All I could hear was the clock ticking slower than on a Friday afternoon in high school, the sound of traffic outside the window, and tapping above my head. Tap tap
Tap tap
Tap tap
The tapping sound wasn't normal. My eyes darted towards the cupboard in a hurry, fearing the door was about to fall on me. Thankfully, it was as still as a vegan pondering the moral implications of everything on lunch menu when they *didn't* have someone there to complain to. Upon tilting my head, I noticed something inside the cupboard. Through the dark crevice, I saw two brown eyes starring right at me. I nearly had a heart attack as I rolled away from my desk in a frenzy. A flurry of possible explanations flooded my mind: it was a prank, a plush toy, a photo, a trick of the light. As I contemplated the many possibilities, I saw the eyes blink, and then retract into the darkness with a scurrying sound. I tried to still my frantic heart by taking a few long breaths, but it was as successful as using a single pouch of sand to stop a flood. I was terrified. If it had been a prank and Id been filmed, my reaction video would have gone viral. Here I was, an adult, freaking out over nothing. Horses still galloping in my chest, I reached for the first solid object at my disposal: a large photo frame hanging on the wall. I'm not sure how useful it would have been as a shield *or* as a weapon, but holding the 11x17 wooden frame made me feel just a *bit* safer. Slowly and cautiously, I reached a trembling hand to the cupboard door. Swallowing saliva as thick as rubber cement, I pulled it open, readying myself for what might be inside. The cupboard was empty. Well, not completely empty. My gym bag, emergency clothes, and work-related books were all in their respective places, but that was it. No creepy teddy bear, no scary photo, and, more importantly, no monster. I let out a sigh of relief, and laughed at myself for getting so scared. * Youre just imagining things*, I thought. Yeah, imagining a pair of eyes in the cupboard. I closed the door as far as it would go, and went back to work. For the rest of the afternoon, I jumped at every snap of the building settling and every gust of air from the A/C unit. My eyes continuously checked the crack above my head while my body tensed to the point of making my neck stiff. I felt like a child afraid of an unclosed closet door at night. I was beyond happy when it was finally time to go home. By the next morning, Id convinced myself that I was being silly. There was nothing in the cupboard. Heck, there wasn't even room for something to hide there anyway. It was business as usual for most of the morning, though as the day wore on, the feeling of loneliness came back. Even when he was around, it wasn't as though my office mate was chatty: we barely exchanged more than a casual hello and goodbye, but his absence still weighed heavily on me. I needed his presence, if just to hear his chair squeaking or his exasperated sighs whenever the boss emailed us. It was just so quiet without him there. Tap tap

I heard the light tapping sound above me. The hairs on the back of my neck turned to porcupine quills. Tap tap tap tap
Tap tap tap tap
I looked up. Tap tap tap tap tap tap
Tap tap tap tap tap tap
A hand. A shrivelled, rust-colored hand fingered out of the cupboard through the open crack. Its black, broken fingernails tapped against the polished surface in a rhythm that seemed to mimic my heartbeat. They moved faster as I pulled away and screamed a gut-wrenching scream. My heart pounded against my chest with the force of a crash test car smashing into a brick wall. To hell with logic, I reacted with pure instinct, leaping off of my chair so I could swing it towards the cupboard door. The hand retracted as I hit the surface, and pushed the door shut in one quick motion. The entire cupboard and its supporting structure shook wildly for a few moments, but then it stopped. I kept my chair over the door for as long as I could, until my arms tired, and I had to set it down. The broken door creaked open, but nothing came out. I dont know whether it was bravery or stupidity, but I opened the cupboard to try and see who was inside. Once again, I found it empty, but for my belongings. I took everything out, and then checked every nook and cranny for an explanation. Whoever or whatever was messing with me had to have a point of entry. Maybe it was some homeless person living in the walls? I dont know. Id read stranger things. Try as I might, I couldn't find an opening. Everything was bolted in tight, not a loose panel in sight. * Fuck this*, I thought, gathering my things. I wasn't spending another minute in that office. Come morning, I knew I had to go back to work. The boss would notice my absence. Still, I took precautions: I brought my tools to work. Union citation be damned, I was taking apart that cabinet. It took all morning, but I finally managed to dismantle the cupboard and its supporting structure, leaving only a bright white wall in its place. I piled the disassembled pieces on my colleagues side of the room, and went back to work. Id love to say that thats how my ordeal ended, but it wasn't. You see, this morning, I came in to work again. At first, everything was perfectly normal. By noon, I was feeling lonely, but then, I heard something coming from my co-workers workstation. I wheeled myself over and saw that the cabinet pieces were missing. * The janitor probably threw them away*, I hoped. As I turned back towards my desk, I noticed my recycling bin was shaking lightly. Had I accidentally hit it? Tap tap
Tap-tap Tap-tap Tap-tap
The familiar, heartbeat-like sound filled my ears as I approached the bin, increasing along with my own beat. I began to quiver as I looked into the inside. Beneath unorganized stacks of discarded papers, I could see two brown eyes staring back at me. I ran away, without even locking the door behind him. Now I'm home, where its safe, quiet and alone. Where all I can hear is the TV in the background, and the tapping from the kitchen. Tap tap

I was so excited that I studied alot and did my homework very quickly.

Dear fellow reddit members, I have been in a relationship with a girl I met in college for 5 years now. She had switched her degree, hence we were in the same class despite our age gap. We studied together for a test, and after that we dated for 6 months before entering a relationship. For the first three years things went well, as we were exploring things together. I think she revelead several characters traits that desirable in a long-term partner. However, after three years, I feel that we've grown apart. She is a nice person, patient and calm, altough insecure about herself. But I feel she respects me and tries to support my goals, which I do not take for granted, specially in the age we're living in. I am a loner person, who tends to dedicate his time to studying and working, and prefer to spend time alone with her or a small group of people, and she also respects and understand that. However, where I think we drift apart is regarding our attitude towards our future. I know that life is pretty tough, and I try to work and safe to have a more secure future. She is more easy going regardings these issues. I had to push her to get her first job, at 27, and up to this moment I wish she had taken more steps towards helping securing a better future for ourselves, specially since she would also like to have a family. This messes up my mind because I grew up in a family which struggled financially and I am afraid that this might be the Journey that is ahead for me. I am sorry, I do not mean to be ungrateful. Relationships are hard. Emotions are hard. I just feel strange and I was hoping some feedback could help me understand this situation more clearly","I know that life is pretty tough, and I try to work and safe to have a more secure future.",1248,0,1

This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013. ---
Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away. That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars. So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black. I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place. The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking. I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned. I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked. I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired. In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead. It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus. I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert. At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again. More hours. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon. Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance. My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams. Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky. Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face. A fellow wanderer. I felt calm. Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last. She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast. Who is she? She is the one who saved me.","I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.",2199,0,1

s_1965_10,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Adderall potentiates benadryl tripping?! Had a really wierd experience today that doesn't make much sense. This is also essentially a trip report. For reference, I'm 22, 103lbs (mild degenerative disorder), I have tried many different drugs; and as a general rule substances do tend to effect me strongly. So last night I took 30mgs of adderall while hanging out with a buddy. Was intense, but I still had a good time. Anyway few hours later I am starting to come down and I really want to get sleep before work today so I take 50mgs of benadryl. JUST 50mg, two standard doses. Occasionally I've taken 25/50mg to get to sleep at night but I've definitely never experienced anything on it before other than getting drowsy...so, like twenty minutes later I'm getting in bed, and I turn on this white noise ten hour youtube video I sometimes use to help me sleep. I lay there for a while, before noticing that I'm hearing strange noises in the video that I haven't heard in it before. Mechanical noises. What sounds like garbled voices. Wondering what the fuck is up with my ears, I turn the light on, intending to see if I still hear it after moving around for a moment. That's when I notice mild but obvious kaleidoscope visuals on my walls. So I lay back down with the light on, and for maybe ten, fifteen minutes I am watching the patterns trying to figure out how the fuck I have psychedelic kaleidoscopes out of nowhere; while only on an adderall comedown. And then; I saw the first translucent spider moving inside the wall. I immediately made the connection that it had to somehow have been the benadryl - even though I've never tried to trip dph before I follow a lot of drug subreddits and know about it from there, and I have a friend who has done it, 700+ club and all; and he's described the experience/visuals in detail to me. So now I'm laying there wondering how a dose of benadryl that has never effected me beyond making me drowsy before, is suddenly making me see and hear things. The only different variable from taking it in the past was now I had adderal in my system. I've researched pharmacology about both of them this afternoon, and haven't found any answers... Anyway, I got several different effects, mostly visual. It was like there was another, thin layer of reality inside the walls of my room; which was where most of the stuff I saw was. There was also a thin layer over my vision - where the shadows and definitions of distance in my room made up another realm that I could kind of see into. There was a fair amount of translucent spiders, and they felt pretty real. They moved completely realistically, y'know the spider movements that make your skin crawl and shit. The only time they did more than moving around inside the wall though was when one came out from behind my poster, and suddenly dropped down towards me before vanishing. I jumped pretty hard lol. Occasionally I saw some bugs, like a centipede, one of those deep sea spider crabs, a beatle, and even bacteria like you'd see moving under a microscope. All translucent though. If my eyes unfocused, the realm I could very faintly see within the natural shadows in my room would show me huge shadow spiders; that for some reason were always directly walking towards me. I also had little visual glitches. Pieces of different things in my room would jump out of place, then go right back when I would look directly at it. There were little light distortions. Out of the corner of my eye my poster would be distorted or show something different. After a while I even saw a few faces in the wall, although they were mostly translucent and didn't go anywhere else. If I focused on them I would hear their voice in my head. They felt kind of sinister. As I laid there I also noticed my thoughts this whole time had been wild, nonsensical and almost cartoony. Just kind of going like that in the background. I was also pretty tired at this point, and as I focused more on the nonsensical thinking; occasionally the things I was seeing in my head would suddenly appear on a surface in my vision, almost as though that item had turned into a flat screen TV. These effects, while definitely present; weren't very strong or overwhelming. I didn't have much of a headspace other than a mild, numb delirious state, and physically just lethargy. I fell asleep after an hour or so. This was all very wierd for me. I didn't feel negative at all during it, I was just morbidly curious and fascinated by what I was experiencing. I did notice things had, just...an overall sinister feel to them. But it wasn't enough to freak me out. I am aware how nightmarish benadryl can get on high doses, how excruciatingly physically unpleasant and even permanently traumatizing and damaging the mental state can be. And so I still don't ever want to go there even after this. I am extremely curious though, I do want to see more of what I saw with this. I think in a week or so I'll try and recreate the experience. Take adderall again, wait a couple hours or so and this time take a somewhat larger benadryl dose. Definitely not more than 100/150mg if only 50 did this to me. In the meantime if any of you have any clue how this was chemically or psychologically possible I'd love to hear it. TL;DR - I took a standard benadryl dose on an adderall comedown to try and fall asleep; it made me dph trip and I can't figure out how or why. I did my best to outline the experience.","Occasionally I've taken 25/50mg to get to sleep at night but I've definitely never experienced anything on it before other than getting drowsy...so, like twenty minutes later I'm getting in bed, and I turn on this white noise ten hour youtube video I sometimes use to help me sleep.",578,3,1

I seem to remember^[citation ^needed] that appetite suppression has been linked to the patient's genetics, so YMMV. This stuff is used to treat eating disorders, though, so that gives you an idea of how powerful it is in this respect. The effect only lasts so long as you are actually on the meds, so breakfast (and probably dinner) shouldn't be affected at all. Methylphenidate already has a rough comedown, though, and low blood sugar makes it much worse, so it's not a good idea to let yourself have two meals. Speaking personally: sometimes it's a simple matter of the MPD turning my focus into a freight train that barrels right past the feeding cue station and does not want to stop. It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing. SOMETIMES though it causes revulsion to the thought of food. I liken it to that feeling you get when you've eaten too much and someone offers you more food. My body finds it hard to *believe* that it could need sustenance, and my brain doesn't appreciate being taken off hyperfocus mode to do something it doesn't think it needs to do. Pushing past this can be tricky but there are always things I can find that my body will be OK with. I'm not a picky eater, but MPD makes me one. Little snacks help but it's better to bite the bullet and eat a full meal on schedule. I also have unrelated colitis, so this may be a factor in my case. Honestly, the comedown from MPD is the biggest problem for me. I turn into a big bearded diva if I'm not careful, so I NEED to remember to have lunch. This will seem unmanageable at first but go easy on yourself in the late afternoon (taking a 5 mg ritalin at around 2:30 also helps soften the down curve for some), and it will subside after awhile
Was the doctor putting you on *both* atomoxetine and MPD though? As I said Strattera would be the bigger concern for me with the things you listed. PS: Yeah, people can negative about this med. I keep coming back to it though, and recently went back on after 2-3 years without anything. People have cause to be negative about all of the meds, though. Nothing is going to be 100% take-the-good-leave-the-bad. It's a matter of finding what works best for you. Adderall, for instance, is not something I want to touch ever again. Other people on this sub will tell you the opposite, but that's just what works for our individual brains.","It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing.",763,2,1

The doctor diagnosed me with chronic depression (I've had depression since I was 11/12 years old... I'm 26 now) and anxiety. He felt Lexapro would be a good start for me to be on it.

I feel my body running on fumes. I'm exhausted. Though I feel the need to be on computer often now because I find myself becoming more entertained on it. I feel the need to research and find new ideas in life. Am I trying too hard to pursue, trying to get my life back in order? To make up for lost times?? I don't know, I don't get myself. I still find myself, staying inside at my home and I would be on computer most of the time. I think it's fear of change. There are times when I would think that change is good. It's nice doing something different. But there are times when I would lose interest, no motivation to do something different, to do something productive and I would try, at all cost, to avoid change because I am feeling comfortable with the way I am and how I am. I am still adjusting to the medication so the question would be when would it start working for me? I know the doctor said it may take 4 to 6 weeks to take in full effect of the medication.

s_2890_292,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"You Don't Do That To Family Grandma started to lose her mind as she aged, and Mother thought it would be wise to take her into our home. She thought it might slow the progression, or at least keep her comfortable until her mind was emptied of every last one of it's marbles. Grandma was always a strict, bitter, and admittedly terrifying woman. She was well respected, but also feared. No one dared stand up to her, even as she started insisting that her delusions and hallucinations were true. We went along with it, but we also anxiously awaited the day that the 90 year old would pass. Myself being nearly twenty five meant that I did the majority of the housework to pay my dues, and Grandma was strict about it. Dad's been gone my entire life, I had no other siblings, and an ectopic pregnancy ruined my chances at having my own family and tore apart my fragile relationship. These two women are all I've got, and I needed them when I was alone and my mind slunk into dark places. Living with my mother wasn't the most desirable thing, but since my loss I haven't been able to function at 100%. Mom could use the help anyways, living alone can be depressing. I had been back home for a month when Grandma had come to stay with us. She wasn't quite as crazy when she first got there, just constantly mumbling about voices. I wasn't ecstatic about housing and caring for a mad woman, but I figured it could be worse. I thought it would be something else to take my mind off of constant dark thoughts, but she ended up being a black hole. After a few weeks of staying with us her condition was becoming noticeably worse. Her mumbling turned to shouting, and she began insisting the things she saw and heard were real. We had to play along or risk facing a violent outburst. She'd throw anything close enough to grab, and it fucking hurt if you were in the way of whatever she was throwing. We were nearly two months into this hell when she got my mother across the chest with a plate. It cut her deeply, and she had to go to the hospital for stitches. Grandma had always been a bitter woman, but this illness was bringing it to new levels. Mom refused to tell anyone outside the family how she really got the injury, and you could tell the secret was eating her up inside. She followed the one most important rule: You don't do that to family. Which meant, you *never* admit to someone outside the family that someone inside did something wrong. It was a rule that had been heavily enforced for generations. After that incident the situation in the house got very tense, and it made me wish I could get my shit together enough to leave. I'd feel awful leaving my mother alone with Grandma though. Another month and things were intolerable. The house was a constant cascade of noises, TVs, radios, and loud uncomfortable voices filled any silence. Silence was no longer allowed. Partaking in the delusions meant more than just patting the old woman on the shoulder and saying, Yes, I hear it too. We had to help her block out the voices, or face her wrath. I honestly couldn't understand why my mother wouldn't just put her in a home. I'd asked her, and every time she gave the same reply, You don't do that to family. I can understand the sentiment, I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if I had a child who sent me away to die in a false paradise. Old age homes are depressing, I've never met someone with any happy stories about sending a family member to one. Now, Grandma would be a different case. She didn't really deserve the amount of kindness we afforded her, but it wasn't entirely her fault. Sure she was a bitch before she went crazy, but it wasn't nearly as bad. The constant noise was enough to drive you up the wall, and I ended up finally using my prescription for sleeping pills. Along with the antidepressants I'd already been taking they helped enough to bring living there to a level only slightly below intolerable. It was okay, at least I could sleep through the noise. Mom didn't get the luxury of taking pills to shut it out, though she tried. The sleeping pills didn't work well enough for her, and the blaring radio coming from Grandma's room kept her up nearly every night. I think her true breaking point was about a month and a half ago. We were sitting down for dinner together, both the tv and radio were screaming the news from the living room. I could tell she was agitated, but I didn't realize how much until she got up and unplugged everything. The house fell into a moment of silence before Grandma started screaming. Laura, Laura! Why are you letting them take me! * She shrieked, grasping her head in both hands. After another quiet moment she looked to me instead, Mary, sweet child, don't let her do this to me. God, make it stop! * MAKE IT STOP!* I recoiled as her voice raised, unsure of what to do. Grandma it's okay, please--
Shut the *fuck* up. Is it so hard to just have a minute of quiet? My mother cut me off with a glare. I was shocked, to say the least. I didn't understand why she was suddenly and so aggressively deciding to stop playing into Grandma's delusions. I didn't have time to ask her either, because that was the moment when a butter knife flew across the table. The heavy metal handle her hit her just above her temple, and the blood was immediate. She was pissed, but in a terrifyingly calm way. She touched her fingers to the wound, looked at the blood, and smiled. You fucking *bitch,* She said in a low voice, I care for you, take you into my home, put up with your bullshit, and when we don't play along for thirty seconds you hurt us? Grandma looked a little shocked but resumed her yelling, They're going to take me, they took my baby! Look how she disobeys me, she's handing me to the voices! Mother shook her head and walked away from the table, and I did the only thing I thought would help. I started a random conversation with Grandma, something to distract her from her screaming and give my mom a chance to calm down and relax. It wasn't very helpful, I wasn't loud enough to block out the false voices in Grandma's head. I ended up sitting her in front of the TV and putting the news back on at a disgustingly loud volume. I went to find my mom and ask her if she was okay. She was in the bathroom tending to her wound. Are you going to the hospital? Did you really turn that damn TV back on? She replied without looking at me. Um.. Yea. I figured it was better than the screaming..
I'm not going anywhere, someone will wonder why I've needed stitches twice in as many months. We don't talk about this kind of thing with other people. You don't do that to family. Oh, and stop making noise. I have a migraine and I'm going to lose it on someone if I hear another sound for the rest of the day. She pushed past me and walked away, leaving me conflicted. I spent the rest of the day trying to deal with the screaming, and when I could no longer take it I decided I needed to calm Grandma down. Mom had gotten so pissed off that she had moved the TV and radio from the living room into her own bedroom and closed herself in with them. There was only screaming to be heard in the house. I spent hours trying to talk Grandma out of it, but it only calmed her slightly. When mom finally came out of the room she looked exhausted. Didn't I tell you to shut up? She sighed. I felt bad for disobeying, but I didn't know how else to deal with it. You want tea Mary? Im gonna make us all some tea so we can forget about this stressful day. I nodded, wanting to avoid her freaking out again. We all sat and drank the tea, while Mom sang loudly to avoid the screaming. It was almost a peaceful moment. I checked the time after we finished and it was getting late, so I helped Grandma up the stairs and into bed. I turned on her bedside radio, and she was asleep within a few minutes. Relative peace at last. The day had exhausted me. I called a goodnight down the stairs to mom, and went into my own room. I couldn't immediately find my sleeping pills, but I was so exhausted that I didn't bother searching. I'd sleep fine without taking one. I slept better than I had in months, it was deep and peaceful and when I finally woke up I wished I could have stayed asleep forever. It was still dark, I was groggy and in a great amount of pain. I brought my hand to my face and I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I ran to the bathroom and caught sight of myself in the mirror, and my mouth bled as it attempted to open and vomit. I choked it down and cried silent tears. My mouth was sewn shut. Somehow through my shock I noticed an empty pill bottle in the sink, my sleeping pills. I had refilled the prescription only two days ago, meaning that nearly thirty pills had been used. I felt sick as I realized what my mother had done. I ran to Grandma's room next, and found her in the same mutilated state as I was. Only, she was also cold to the touch. I fought the urge to vomit again, and left the room. She either overdosed or asphyxiated and I wasn't trained to tell which was the case with her mouth sewn. I couldn't find my mother anywhere in the house, and when I pulled out my phone I realized that she could be anywhere right now. I had slept for nearly two days. No wonder I didn't wake up while being mutilated, I was nearly comatose. I wanted to call the police, but as I was about to dial I kicked myself internally. * You can't talk, stupid.* I walked my sorry ass to the nearest hospital, not wanting to traumatize anyone on the way. My car was missing, so I guess that's what mom used. The hospital staff nearly shit themselves when I walked into the emergency room, it was *almost* funny. This entire part if my journey is fairly boring, except for when they realized that behind my sewn lips I had no tongue. They replaced it, but I haven't learned how to speak again yet. I'm scared to talk ever again. The police came to question me about what happened, but I only wrote down that I couldn't remember. Obviously my mother was a suspect, they had found Grandma's body in her house. I know it seems messed up that I wouldn't directly admit what my mother did, but I have three very good reasons for that. She was already the only suspect. I was afraid she'd find me and punish me again for speaking when I shouldn't. You don't do that to family. [HF](<URL>)",I choked it down and cried silent tears.,8503,0,1

It took three months to get them to trust me. Three months spent in virtual isolation; three months spent eating one step better than garbage just to survive. I figured makeshift prisons run by Chinese rebels would hardly be luxurious, but those three months will haunt my sleep if I survive this. Until the day this struggle ends, there are far worse nightmares to faceand while awake. That Starbucks, that day, those seven Venti coffees; I broke something in myself three months ago while sitting at that table guzzling stimulant. Out the window and across the street I could see ramshackle ghettos, while on my side of the divide everything was clean, bright, and happy. Each coffee subtly changed that dynamic. I would say that the ideal level of caffeination for busy-bee workers is somewhere between half a Venti black coffee at minimum and two full ones at maximum. While in that range, every sip I took gradually shrank my awareness in a way only an experienced caffeine addict could notice. Creativity and thinking outside the box became slightly harder while focusing on specific mundane tasks became slightly easier. In that regard, I almost became more concerned with writing down my changing symptoms than with actually drinking the coffee. It took an act of will to force myself to proceed. I'd kicked caffeine for the first time in years, but now I'd given myself back to it, and my brain was very happy with the flood of energy. It wanted to enjoy the high; it did not want to keep drinking with the specific intent to make myself sick. Nevertheless, I began gulping more even as my pulse rose and my fingers began subtly shaking. The third full coffee brought the change in the world's tone to a noticeable level. The bright colors had faded in favor of greys and browns, and the street outside was dingy and cracked in small ways I had not noticed before. The ghetto across from me remained horrible; I watched a haggard mother hang laundry on a high rope strung between two rotting wooden spires. Each breath brought that surge of fire I recognized as the limit of caffeination, and I had to carefully regulate myself to keep my heart rate down. For now, I was still fine, but I was only at three of seven coffees. Taking a deep breath, I chugged the fourth. The tilt in my perceptions nearly made me slide from my seat. The world had not shifted physically, but my sense of myself within it certainly had. Looking around, I sighted for the first time bits of garbage, rust, and decay on my side of the divide. People walking on the streets didn't seem to notice; one stepped in what looked like dog excrement but continued walking without bothering to scrape it off. I watched three workers inside the Starbucks itself ignore a small pile of trash that customers kept stepping on. But still I was submerged in a long, deep, and slow river of complacency. My body was agitated, but my mind was full of excuses not to notice, mention, or otherwise regard these strange discrepancies. Downing the fifth coffee rapidly as a way of surprising myself and breaking through that submersion, I clutched the edges of control to stay centered. Each gasp brought oxygen, while each exhalation brought fuzziness at the edges of my vision. I began to feel claustrophobic and unsafe. Rusted corners and smelly bits of garbage made themselves prominent in my awareness; I slung my bag and grabbed my two remaining coffees and stumbled out onto the street. The sub-provincial city of Guangzhou no longer looked to me as all the others that I had visited. I could see character now, mostly in aged buildings off the main path, and the bright colors and cleanliness had been stripped away. This place was run down and industrial, and I had not seen it as such until my fifth coffee. The sixth filled me with very unpleasant internal heat. I'd come here ostensibly to investigate a claim that had caught my eye; I was within a block of that location, and wandered along my side of the street opposite the ghetto to investigate the site of the supposed accident. It was a simple alleyway, much like the one in Jerusalem, but this one held stacks of garbage and low pools of unidentifiable filth. I braved the muck to search the walls, and, this time, I was ready when I found the unknown invisible vines. Here goes nothing, indeed. I kept my eyes on the wall and downed my seventh and final coffee. The pain in my head became two directed blades moving through my forehead and temples. I winced, but kept my gaze forward. I needed to see this. If seven coffees didn't blow open the flaw in the lie, nothing would. Someone had pulled the wool over my eyes, and forcing it out of my system was the only way. Shivering horribly and fighting a body-wide surge of dangerous over-stimulation, I watched with triumph as patchwork lines began to weave themselves into existence before me. It was the same material that the doctor in Zimbabwe had found in Kudakwashe's throat. I knew it immediately. It ran along the walls like vines of ivy, but, as the doctor had said, it looked to be some sort of neural tissue. Somehow, it had the ability to hide itself from perception. This was what I'd stabbed into on that Zimbabwean rooftop, and this was what had made everyone around it scream and run at me to defend it. How had it done that? Did it generate some kind of neural field to blanket our senses? What *was* this stuff? Clenching my fists to keep a hold of myself against the tide of caffeine, I followed the neural vines higher and higher with my sight. They'd grown over this building, in the alley in Jerusalem, and high up in Zimbabwe. Where else might these spots of infection be growing? I stepped out of the fetid alley to follow its run further, but froze in horrified awe as I got my first unedited visual of the sub-city. There were two perceptions there; one, the faux clean clone, the other a monstrously overgrown hive. My vision flickered as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing: *a veritable jungle of hanging neural vines, conduits, and pillars had grown across the entire city.* Thick masses hung between high buildings; curving nerves spread out fractally along nearby streets. The shock and the caffeine combined were too much. I fell to my knees at the whim of a body-wide seizing vomit. Worse, the pain in my temples had become what felt like motion, and a writhing therein made me scream and grip myself to fight for sanity. Static blurred my sight, random voices shouted in my hearing, and two long worms of strange tissue burrowed out the sides of my eyes, fell to the dirty street, and shriveled up. Drops of blood fell straight down from my vision as I stared at what had just crawled out of my temples and died on the ground before me. The caffeine wracked me with pain, but I knew now that I'd done it: I'd poisoned myself hard enough that my perceptions had finally become clear. What the hell were they? Entities in their own right? Or just some form of connection to the previously invisible neural jungles growing all over the world? Had the human race evolved some sort of literal group hive mind, or were we under attack by something else? The madman. He'd written of this. He'd been intent on cutting the neural fibers out of my eyes directly. That's what he'd done to himself, and that was how he'd gained the ability to truly *see.* I'd chosen another route, but it had not been without its risks. I threw up twice more before losing consciousness on the sidewalk. Four hundred and fifteen milligrams of caffeine in a Venti black coffee, and I'd had seven. Five grams was a potentially lethal dose, and I'd had at least sixty percent of that. I descended into darkness with nothing but a small hope that my years as a coffee addict would see me through this. The first question I became aware of was simple. "" How did you do that?"" Several periods of blurred consciousness brought me to waking in a sealed underground parking lot that looked like it had never been finished. The man who had spoken was not present, but he soon visited with food and water. He asked again in perfect English, ""How did you do that?"" I shook with the after-effects of caffeine near-overdose, but managed to respond, ""Do what?"" He kicked me in the ribsnot too hard, just enough to show that he was seriousand I said, ""I'll tell you, just please clarify!"" He moved his wrinkled but hardened face closer and tapped my temple. "" Removed your blinders."" I winced at his touch before realizing the implications of his question. "" Wait, you're aware of them? Do you also see the world as it truly is?"" He gave me another sharp kick. "" I've tortured better men than you until they wished for death. Understand your position. I ask, you tell."" I nodded in acceptance. "" I, uh, took sixty percent of a lethal dose of caffeine."" His glare was sharp. "" How did you calculate a lethal dose? The same amount for others may kill them."" ""It was just a guess based on articles I've read,"" I protested, staving off another kick. "" I've been addicted to caffeine for years, so I may have withstood it better."" He pulled back. "" So her story was true. She watched you from our side of the border, and she said you drank coffee until you became violently ill."" I held up my hands to ward off the bright light that his change in position had cast upon me. "" Now a silhouette, he asked, ""And what did you see?"" ""Look,"" I told him, trying to think quickly. "" I don't think you and I are enemies. I've been pursued by crazy people, got my finger cut off, my ear sliced, some guy wanted to cut my eyesI have *no idea* what's going on, but I do think the human race is in serious trouble. There areGod, there's like some sort of infestation out thereit's everywhere! I think we're under attack!"" He gave a dark laugh and moved away, saying, ""You just saved your life, and you don't even know why."" A door slammed somewhere distant, and I was left alone in a poorly lit crumbled stone prison. I walked the length of my confinement for a few hours, finding a scattering of shitty fluorescent lights illuminating empty parking spots and incomplete stairwells. Some of these stairwells led up toward daylight very *very* high up, but nothing but sheer concrete and the occasional rotting foothold presented itself. They had no guards on this exit for a reason: the climb was suicide. An entire month passed before I received my next visitor. I was self-aware of the effects that solitary confinement was having on me, but this was no hallucination. The same man opened a door, but only his guest came inside; that creature that had once crawled out of my severed pinky finger now skittered into the room on bone-white blade-like legs. Ivory eyes watched me unblinking, and I heard its voice in my head again: *Are you done playing the fool?* There was no escape this time, but I still moved back a few steps. "" After a thought, I added, ""I understand what you meant now by my senses betraying me. I've seen it."" The question now is whether you are a double agent. It is exceedingly rare that a human being breaks free from the Entity on its own. Would you have us believe you are just that smart?* I looked past the Bonewalker toward the door where my human former interrogator stood. He seemed very uncomfortable with the creature's presence, and nodded for me to speak carefully. I finally said, ""A little smart, but mostly just way too addicted to caffeine."" It seemed to accept that answer. * You spoke of a man that tried to cut your eyes.* *Describe him.* I gave it the best description I could of the man with the wild glee and surgical knife, but I couldn't tell what it thought of my words. It left immediately, this time jumping into a small open wound on the man at the door's arm; he shivered, pulled a bandage over it, and closed the door. Was he a guard? Or someone higher level? If the crazy doctor was someone this group wanted, then I might have been regarded as a very important prisoner. Indeed, the quality of my given food rose, and guards came in to play cards with me and keep me company. I understood that this was both luxury for my information and a test of my true character; I made sure to be completely honest about every single thing they asked me. I had nothing to hide. I even told them about the breakup, and my hollow reactions to it. At the end of the second month, the Bonewalker returned. This time, I was in the open-topped stairwell standing in the rain, but it didn't seem to care about the falling liquid. * The guards seem to think you're not a liar.* I'd had plenty of time to craft my strategy. "" Tell me one thing. I assume the Entity is something related to the neural fibers growing all over the world. Are you opposed to it?"" The creature's ivory eyes gave no hint of connotation or elaboration. * ""Then that means we're on the same side,"" I told it, taking a risk. "" Regardless of whatever organization or power structure you've got control of."" *You would choose the more personable of two dooms?* it asked. * You will remain untreated, for it can sense the blood-bond. None of my humans can ever truly be a part of its society.* There was a chance I would come off as a double agent fishing for information, but I also genuinely wanted to know. "" How much do you control?"" *Thirty percent.* So the ghettos had been made terrifying in our perceptions on purpose to separate us from the opposition. "" Thirty percent of China, that's a sizable""
*Of the Earth,* it responded. A clicking followed, a sound I took to be laughter. * You're not a double agent. You're too full of yourself, like most humans. Know that you will be watched, and if you betray us, you will die in the manner you are most afraid of.* Could it see that? Could it see my fears? I gulped as it crawled away without another word. And what of being watched? Did it mean I was to be released? The third month was full of tension and confusion. Gone were the guards and the visits. Had I done something wrong? Finally, the man who had first interrogated me dragged me out the door and up a long set of stairs to release me into a moderately disheveled area that I might once have seen as ruined and horrible. After undoing a temporary pair of handcuffs, he told me, ""That doctor has a special interest in you. Let him find you, then bring him to us. He is very important to this fight."" I nodded, and accepted money and a folded set of clothes from him. ""And take a shower,"" he said as a final note of goodbye. "" I did reekbut there was wind to carry the smell away and a sun in the sky. I was free. Wandering the streets and watching the poor go about their lives the best they could with what they had on hand, I realized that life was precious. I'd been doing nothing with it since I'd been hollowed out by someone I'd loved, and yet here there were people that did not have the suits or the offices or the coffeepeople making do, raising kids, and having afternoon chats from window to window. This was the Bonewalker's territory, and it was not altogether bad. The divide between territories was stark. Neural masses hung from building to building directly across the final street, and I could see raised lines of parasitic flesh along the temples of passersby. My God, it hadn't been a caffeine nightmare! Seventy percent of the Earth had been overtaken by an infection of unknown proportions, and the other thirty percent held fast only under the vicious rule of the Bonewalker. Where was the human spirit in all this? Where was *our* faction? Eyes were upon me even thenfrom both sidesso I resolved to keep my counsel to myself. If there was to be one at all, I had to be the start of our faction. I'd figured this out myself, freed my own perceptions through risk and calculated daring, and I'd dodged the Bonewalker's control as well. I knew who my first true ally would be, too: the very man that creature wanted. Who are you, Doctor? What do you have that both these nightmares want? I've left enough keywords in this for you to find it, and I know you're obsessive enough to contact me despite the risk. I'm back in the States, and I have a suspicion you know where to find me. ---

To be honest, I have a pretty good life. I have a job with a major energy corporation, albeit a contract position. I got married a week and a half ago to a wonderful supportive man who adores me. We adopted a kitten a few weeks ago. But my fucking job. I loathe it. I'm basically a data entry drone. They're gradually giving me more responsibilities, but they haven't given any hints that I'll be offered a full time (salaried) position. I'm an incredibly efficient worker and I finish my work pretty quickly (unintentionally). When I finish my work, I'm sent home. I fucking hate it, because as a newlywed and someone with student loans, I CANT AFFORD TO BE SENT HOME. But I also can't slow down my work speed, I already have tried and realized I just can't. I don't want to go to a job where I have to interact with people. I want to work from home. I have incredible potential and know that I should be doing more with my life but by not getting an internship in college I royally screwed myself and am stuck at a soul-sucking job day in and day out, where my contract could end any day. Not to mention I have had migraines the past couple months, and have missed more work than I should. I got a talking to by my boss last week about it. But yesterday she decided to come in hacking up a lung and now I'm feeling feverish. It's just a shit ball rolling down shit hill and I just want to be out. I'm sure most of us know what the job market is like right now; it's nearly impossible to find a job with limited experience. This is my first professional job and I've only been there 3 1/2 months but I want something new. I don't know where I'm going with this... I just want a new job. I want to work from home. TL;DR: I'm too efficient at my job. I've been sick quite a bit recently and my boss just got me sick again, but I can't afford to miss work.

I only started referring to it as a disease recently. I was stupid enough to think how can negative thoughts, and emotions be a disease. Its not rocket science. I have a chemical imbalance in the brain that requires me to see a psychologist and take medications. It by no means is cured. My psychologist tends to compare it to diabetes (Ive gotten flak for the comparison), in which it never really goes away, Ive just gotta learn to manage it. I have a shitty attitude, and miserable demeanor. Not afraid to admit it. Ive done some terrible things in my life that I carry extreme guilt for. I would apologize to those Ive affected but they would prefer to never see me again, which I cant blame them. The bridges burned, the insults spewed, the disinterest in others, it can be rooted to one thing, depression. Its caused me to drive away every friend I have. Ive become a better person though, Ive completely dropped drugs and alcohol, and go to the gym everyday. Although Ive tainted my reputation as a person. Its hard for people to give me a second chance, in which I understand. Long story short, I hope someone can relate to this post. I only speak to two people a week, my psychologist, and trainer.

Mine's as ravenous as ever. And keto foods are so calorie dense. I've tried all the tricks: green tea, water, loads of greens, coconut oil, etc... I don't have cravings, though, I just am always hungry. I'm also tired all the time. Right now I'm trying eat around 1400 calories/day, but frequently go up to 1800 or 2000. Maybe 2 hours of working out every week, a mix of strength and walking on an incline. My usual day of meals is as follows:
*Breakfast*: almonds and string cheese (about 400 calories worth)
*Lunch*: Greek salad with EVOO and red wine vinegar + gyro meat or chicken
*Dinner*: 80/20 beef with vegetables (either as a taco salad or with cauliflower). *Snacks*: Handful of almonds, spoonful of almond butter, pan fried queso blanco, a few strawberries

Lost the initial water weight, but nothing else, which I am attributing to my going above the calories I should have. Note: PCOS is linked to lowered BMR.

s_313_493,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"Coming Out [NSFW] Like so much misfortune in my life, the seeds of these events were planted from my fathers words. Concise, if not eloquent, he always knew how to cut to my center. Did you fuck any girls, yet? Probably not. And to think, all that college poon, just wasted on a queer like you. He was drunk again. The fifth night in a row and every night since Id been home between college terms. The thing is, I wasnt a queer... at least I was pretty sure that I wasnt. For reasons unknown in my early (to not-so-early) years I just wasnt interested in sex. It hadnt really been a problem until high school and then it seemed like it was just getting worse since then. Now it was obvious that I was behind the times. It seemed like everyone I knew had at least been with someone, and it was becoming a source of anxiety. Ironically, my father's stream of vitriol was what prompted me to cement my sexual preferences once and for all. I resolved that once I got back to school, I would do it. Id have sex. After all, isnt getting to know yourself what college is supposed to be all about? If I was gay, I knew that I couldnt tell anyone. My own parents would kick me out of the house -- and that was if my father didnt try to strangle it out of me first. But I had to know. I normally spent a lot of my nights alone in my room but my two roommates, John and Macy were not those kind of people. Every weekend it seemed like they were setting out to a bar or an event or a party. They usually invited me as a polite formality, and I could see the surprise on their face when the first Friday night back, I accepted. I almost felt bad, until John started acting really excited to have me along. Whether or not he was pretending, I couldnt tell. We went to a house party at some friends of Macys. Her and John seemed to know everyone, and each of those people knew everyone as else, interconnected in a web of sort of reverse web that I couldnt penetrate. I tried not to hang on John and Macy, but my awkwardness was filling the house, and left me gasping for some fresh air. Outside, through the haze of Marlboros, Camels and Newports, is when I first saw *her*. She was beautiful. Cropped, white-blonde hair hung down along the flawless pale skin of her neck. Blue eyes as deep as the Pacific pierced through the smoke... *at me*. Its clich, but she was so perfect that my breath caught in my throat. The smoke burned until I choked and coughed it out. When I looked up through tear-streamed eyes, I saw her smile at me and then take a sip of beer from the bottle. John burst out of the house and grabbed onto my arm, taken with a sudden acute case of close-talking-itis. Were going to a strip club, come on! Im having fun here. Look, Macy mentioned that youre a virgin, and everybodys going to go for you to see your first pair. She told you that? Its not exactly the worlds best-kept secret, man. I looked for the girl, but she must have gone back inside. Fuck yeah! Ever been to one before? We packed at least a dozen people and their drinks into Johns tiny sedan. The club was named after a color. Turquoise or Magenta or something. It hardly matters, Im not writing a recommendation for the place anyway. I was just getting to the point of drunkenness where I wasnt afraid to speak my mind. This is just kind of sad, I said. Macy was the only one that heard. I mean... These people, theyre trapped here. Like they have to do this. What, you mean the girls? Yeah, the girls, but the guys too, guys who would come to a place like this. I mean, they realize that nothing is going to happen with these girls, right? Would you lighten up? No wonder youre a virgin. She turned around and grabbed a girl by the arm. How much for a lap dance? For you, honey? For my friend. First timer. Oh alright. She glanced at me through caked on makeup. I wondered how many kids she had. How you doing? Having fun tonight? Just sit back and relax. Only, I couldnt relax. Every time the disco lights spun, I could see the pimples on her lower back. She had horrible skin. Before she moved my hands away, Id felt what I was pretty sure was a C-section scar arcing across her sandpaper skin. Cigarette stained teeth gave her a smile like Gollums. I was repulsed, and pushed her off. As I stormed out of the bar, people called out to me, but it was drowned out by the music. John caught up with me outside. What the fuck was that, Alex? Thats not fun for me. Gross and its sad. I just dont want to do it anymore. Its not gross! Theyre boobs! Its just not for me. What are you, gay? Wait, are you serious? Youre a- His face showed fear. I remember that of all the things to be afraid of, that had to be the most ridiculous. Mercifully, he shut up. I dont know if he said anything else after that. I was around the corner. I felt the smile on my face before I realized what I was feeling. Only then, I worked my way back in my mind to what Id just done. Come out. My smile turned to the ugly kind you make just before you cry, and I got a lump in my throat. This was happening. Was I really gay? Well, I didnt know for sure. John probably thought I was now. He'd tell everyone. I thought about dad for a second. It made me feel afraid. It wasnt the first time that the distance of college to my home town had comforted me. But still, something scared me about... well... *myself*. They say that you fear what you dont know, but this just didnt work that way. I couldnt just know. There wasnt a blood test for sexuality. You can't just decide. This was something bigger than me and yet inside me. Thoughts and questions swirling in my head, I was sure of just one thing; I needed another fucking drink. All-American Pizza Companys neon sign bathed me in red, white and blue as I walked in. The front of the shop was the restaurant and in the back was a hole-in-the-wall bar that Id seen but never been inside. I ordered a long island iced tea and lit a smoke, and as I exhaled that first drag, there she was, swaying her hips as she strolled through the crowded, busy bar straight toward me. My names Alex, she said. My name is Alex. Thats fun. Ive never been with a guy named Alex before. *Oh fuck.* She sat next to me and stole my cigarette. Wanna do some shots? My memory is a blur after that. Disjointed scenes of a foreign taxi driver screaming Dont soil my seats! the feeling of her biting my lower lip with her front teeth, pulling me into her, sneaking through a dingy hallway into a tiny apartment, the only furniture a bed and a huge mirror, throwing up in a toilet, blood, razors on a nightstand, drips of red staining white sheets. And Alex had a penis. And I couldnt have cared less. She was perfect. I woke up the next morning laying on threadbare stained carpet. Sunlight shone through the windows and became tinted orange-brown by the fly strips hanging there. I found the bathroom on the other side of the empty kitchen. The sink didnt work, and drying blood covered the porcelain and the floor. I yakked again in the toilet. *What the fuck happened last night?* Lifting myself up from the position of prayer, I noticed a cut on my finger. An image of her sucking blood from the cut jumped into my mind. Otherwise unhurt, but more than a little unsettled, I searched the apartment for my clothes. Alexs thin, naked frame didnt stir as I tried to avoid the spots in the floor that creaked loudly. There were cuts on her arms. I felt her pulse just to make sure she was alive, but I wasnt ready to wake her up and face what Id done last night. I needed some time to process it. As I knelt next to the bed, something shiny under her pillow caught my eye. I found the door and left. The next day an unknown number called and texted my phone. You didnt say goodbye. Lets meet up today. Didnt you have a good time? Every time I got one, I started typing a response, but something stopped me from sending any of them. Something wasnt right about Alex. I was afraid of them. Whatever it was that scared me about her didnt stop me from calling them the next weekend after most of a bottle of Jack Daniels. And the next weekend, and the next. Id come home with scratches on my back, my lips and tongue sore and chapped. I was worn out from doing things that I didnt remember. Every time Id wake up in her shit hole apartment and sneak out without waking her up. This became my new routine. I met another girl. Her name was Ashley and she was in my Shakespeare class, though we only realized that after wed talked a few times online. We took things slow. Partly because thats what felt right, but also to keep her from finding the marks that appeared on my body every weekend. Things were going well until she asked me to meet her friends over the weekend for pizza. You can probably guess the place. I paused for a moment in the glow of the red, white and blue sign. Everything alright? Ashley asked. Feeling a little sick, thats all. Well, do you need to go home? I need desperately to leave, to run away and figure myself out. I need to know what the fuck is going on.* Lets go in. Her friends were great. They were mostly from her church groups and were almost as awkward as me. After the second round of beers, I got up to use the bathroom that was shared with the bar. For some reason that I couldnt place, just as I opened the door, I could picture Alex behind it, waiting for me. The bathroom was empty, but my phone buzzed with a text. Whos the new girl? I had yet to respond to one of Alexs texts, but this was it. I went into the stall and sat down, and as I was typing I got this back. Does she want to join in? I hit send. I cant see you anymore. I sighed and rolled my shoulders, letting some of the pent-up tension out of them. Why did I still feel like she was going to jump out at me? Its not over. Youve got my blood on your hands, Alex. The bathroom smelled like her apartment had when Id woken up that first night. A smell that tasted like pennies, it permeated the bathroom. The smell of blood. Dont text or call anymore. I typed Sorry at the end, but erased it. * Send*
I went back and joined Ashley and her friends. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I silenced it. We went bowling and had more drinks. This was a healthy relationship, and I felt better and better about leaving Alex behind. By the time we got back to my place, I think we both knew where the night was going. I invited her over for Netflix. Not even a specific movie. It was around midnight. It looked like John and Macy had fallen asleep on the couch in front of the television, and in drunken loud whispers we giggled and crept by them to my room. I opened the door for Ashley, and she got about halfway in before her body went rigid. She made a sound like shed been plunged into ice water. At first I didnt see anything. The only light was from the glowing moon coming through the blinds, casting slanting rays. Almost invisible against the sheets, then I saw her eyes first. And she was holding a gun. Ashley ran. I was frozen in place. She didnt know about us, I take it? No, you come in, Alex. Oh, you can come anywhere you want, she writhed around on the bed, arching her back seductively, drawing the muzzle of the gun down her ribs like ivory piano keys. Shut the door, hon. Wouldnt want your roommates to hear us. I didnt move. Her playful smile dropped away. Her voice was low, and demanding, it scared the shit out of me. Shut the fucking door. *Would Ashley call the police?* I wondered. * Or would she think that I was expecting to find a mad gun-wielding transsexual in my bed? How long would it take if she did call?* I entered the room. *Click*
Alex, dont you want me anymore? I managed to get out through my dry, quivering lips. That hurts, Alex, it really does. I even brought something special for you tonight, you know. She picked up something from the floor next to the bed that I hadnt seen before. Some kind of... machine? I didnt know what it was. It was made of metal, and was a collection of joints and screws and levers. A-Alex, I stammered, What is that? Well I know just what you like, Alex. How to get you off. But theres always been something between us. She giggled. A penis between us. I thought that I heard sirens. Alex was assembling the clamps, twisting the wingnuts and tightening everything around her genitals. The police vehicle continued on and the whine of its sirens faded. Not for me. Ready for the big show? She pulled two long levers. Black blood shot out across the room. Undiscernable connecting tissue -- ligaments, blood vessels, tubes full of every bodily fluid imaginable -- the whole glob was pulled out onto the foot of the bed. The smell was fucking incredible. Animal and clinical at the same time. Something woke inside me. She lifted a slender hand, gloved in blood and waved me forward. The whole time she hadnt made a sound, but as I started to thrust, she began to scream. John and Macy knocked on the door. I heard John ask Are you okay in there? After a few minutes, they went away.",For reasons unknown in my early (to not-so-early) years I just wasnt interested in sex.,472,1,1

He passed away one week ago. Since we heard the diagnoses, I have been suffering from recurring panic attacks, been struggling day to day and especially at night with anxiety, and lack of sleep is making it very hard to focus on my usual rescue 'remedies'. My Dr prescribed lorazepam, and upped my citalopram dose six weeks ago. He doesn't want me on the lorazepam for long, but, although the panic attacks have decreased in frequency, they are still happening often and the lorazepam us the only thing I have found so far that works quickly and helps. My main trigger at the moment is panicking that my children are going to catch Noro, and then we will all get it. At the moment, one of them even looking a little off color is sending me straight into a panic attack. I struggle with not being in control and this is one area that I do not cope with the uncertainty and unpredictability of everything.

Session Number - twelve of fifteen as mandated by the State Rehabilitation Program. Go ahead, Laura. Tell me about what happened the day at the park. **Laura:** We were sitting on the park bench - the same one we've spent so much time on over the past couple years. The bigger one with no armbars and room for three people. It was 12:30 in the afternoon. **Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure that was the exact time? **Laura:** I don't fucking know! Jesus Christ, you people. Everything's a blur. I'm doing the best that I can. It was lunch time, okay? I know because Mr. Greg Hamilton was out in the park getting his daily hotdog and barbeque chips. Will you let me talk? Bobby and I were meeting at the bench to talk about what to do next. We were enjoying some ice cream cones that he got us because of how stressful everything had been. I was especially out of it that day and he was trying to cheer me up. For as horrible of a life he's put me through that man has a damn good heart. We had to make a decision that day. **Dr. Sterling:** About-
**Laura:** Yeah. **Dr. Sterling:** We're talking about-
Yes, that decision. I remember telling Bobby that I couldn't stay long...but he showed up with those cones and I couldn't resist his charm. Superman - my favorite. It was hot. I was eating the ice cream pretty fast. It was melting down my hands. It couldn't have been more than five minutes when Bobby broke the silence with his words:
'You know we have to do it.' Time stopped. My hands squeezed the cone so hard it cracked and fractured. All I could do was sit there licking time by. Everything was so...off, but so right. For a moment, I didn't hate myself anymore. I was okay. Then I started seeing the green dots and everything got so bright that I couldn't see. That's the last thing I remember from the park. **Dr. Sterling:** That's the last memory you can recall? **Laura:** Yes. **Dr. Sterling:** Are you sure? **Laura:** Well, no. It...there wasn't anything else that happened at the park. **Dr. Sterling:** Would you like some tea? **Laura:** Yeah, I'd love some. ---
That wasn't all I remembered - it was simply all I was willing to say to Dr. Sterling again. The recording I just transcribed for you was probably the fifth or sixth time I was forced to recount my story. Don't get me wrong, she was an excellent, compassionate woman but even she was skeptical of what happened to me. To the State, I was another junkie who was forced to get clean or go to jail. I believe that impacted her ability to fully trust me. Especially with some of the other heroin addicts I would see in the waiting room. I don't hold any ill will towards her. What happened was so traumatic that I was able to kick heroin with minimal effort - aside from the mandated state program I was forced to go through after my hospital stay. I don't wish it on anyone, but I hope that by sharing my experiences it can create awareness about what the drug can bring you down to. ---
When I was able to see again, I was laying on a cold table staring back at my reflection on a metallic ceiling. I couldn't move at first but I wasn't tied down or anything. It felt like sleep paralysis, if you've ever been through that. No matter how much I struggled to move my body - even wiggle a toe - nothing would happen. I don't remember being scared at all, but when I try hard to remember waking up on that table I run into a mental block. I clearly remember what I saw, and how my body felt. But my emotions and thoughts...I feel like they are being held back. Even to this day. The memory is *right* there but I can't reach it. Almost as if parts of my experience have been censored. Maybe because there were so many bright, blurry lights I wasn't able to focus on my feelings and I just don't have a memory of them. All I can say for certain is that I was on a table because I remember my reflection. I don't have any clue how much time passed. It could have been hours or days. Possibly longer. Possibly shorter. At some point a tall, lanky figure came and injected me in the arm with some sort of serum that burned as it coursed through my veins. I wanted to scream and cry and thrash until I could get off of the table, but my body was motionless. More time passed. My next clear memory is of my legs in stirrups, and the worst pain I've ever felt destroying my abdomen, sucking out my insides. I couldn't see anything except for the lights, but I could feel dozens of thin, warm fingers poking and prodding at every inch of my body. Resonated throughout the area around me. A chant from a murderous cult? Questions from a group of scientists? I don't know. The word haunts my dreams every night. If I even hear the word I break down. The medication can't even protect me from it. I suddenly gained my ability to move as I felt the remaining pieces of my insides being torn away from me. The tall, lanky man stood over me and injected more serum into my neck, causing my world to spin until it went silent and black. I awoke in a hospital bed. So, so many doctors were around me, joined by men and women in suits and two police officers. They had hours of questions for me. The official documentation by the police says that I overdosed on heroin in the park, and Bobby took me to one of those ""back-alley"" doctors to have our baby removed. I don't know if I believe that. They took my baby to the sky for their experiments. They know it. It doesn't matter now. The law is the law. Bobby has been in prison for years.

s_1278_99,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"What is following me? I thought this was over. I wasn't going to post my story because I thought my life was back to normal. That was before last night. When weird things started happening, my step father had just been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. The only people in my house were my mom, my step dad, my boyfriend, and me. My step father couldn't go to the bathroom himself, and if my mom had to go, she would call me into the living room to sit with him. He was never unattended. Furthermore, my room was right beside the bathroom. I could hear anyone coming in or out. Let me also explain about my step father, he was a police officer and where I live, police have to get extensive physicals every year to stay on the force. He also frequently got strep, so he had blood work done every time he had it due to the hospital visit. We had just moved into an older house, and I always felt uneasy in the house. There was just something off about it. Less than a year after we move, my step dad who has always been given a clean bill of health was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. They said it had to have been there for at least 6-7 years. We had no clue where it had come from. I immediately thought of A Haunting in Connecticut, how the boy got sicker after moving into an old house. How else would I explain my step father getting so sick so fast? When the weird stuff started happening to me, my boyfriend isn't living with me. I have always been deathly afraid of the dark. I've slept with my tv on for as long as I can remember. I can't stand the sounds houses make at night, so the sound drowns it out and provides light. I sleeping pretty peacefully when it was disturbed by a dream that wouldn't be scary to normal people. It was an older lady glaring at me. I've never seen this lady, but I had a deep feeling that she was evil and wanted to cause me harm. I woke up with a jolt and was overwhelmed with the same feeling I had in the dream. I can't explain how I know, but I knew it was her. Then I quickly noticed my tv was off. My mom wouldn't turn my tv off because she knows I need it. I got a horrible feeling of dread through me. I quickly grabbed my remote to get the tv back on. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep that night. About a month and a half later, I was still getting that terrified feeling throughout my house occasionally, but I was starting I get used to it because my boyfriend started staying with me. We had been laying in bed all day because it was one of my few days off, so I would know if anyone had gone to the bathroom recently. When I got up to use the bathroom, I could hear water running, which was very odd because no one had been in there. It wasn't possible. When I opened the bathroom door, our bathroom was flooded because someone (something?) had turned our sink on full blast. I quickly called out to my mom who confirmed my suspicions. No one had been to the bathroom. As we cleaned the mess, my mom was comforting me, and I let her reason calm me, quickly turning away any thoughts of paranormal. Sadly, the next part in my story was the worst time in my life. My step father had just been taken to the hospital, and the family had been called in. We were living at the hospital basically. My mom made me go to my grandmother's to get some rest, so my friend Molly drove me and My friend Robin to our respective houses. On the way to Robin's, Molly slammed the brakes and asked if we had seen something run I front of the car. Neither of us had, so we just assumed it was an animal because we live in a mountainous area. Animals weren't uncommon. Nothing happened the rest of the ride, until Molly dropped me off at the end of my drive way. As I was walking toward my house, I saw the figure of a man duck behind a car, so I took off at a sprint to get to the safety of home. When I turned around, I saw a black cat walking toward me from where I had just seen the man. I got into the house and locked the door. I texted Molly what had happened. She replied, ""I don't want to scare you anymore, but I thought it was a black cat that I saw driving Robin home..."" After a short conversation, I drifted off into an uneasy sleep. The next day, I went to my house to clean up some. I must explain that I lived in a high class neighborhood, so there were no stray animals around. When I got to my house, I saw a black cat sitting beside the door. After that, I quickly cleaned up because I didn't want to be in that house any longer. My step father died that night. For a couple months after my step father died, everything was calm, so I chocked everything that had happened as stress. Then one morning as I was getting ready for class, I was brushing my teeth before I showered. I went to turn the water off, but I didn't turn the handle all the way, so I had to reach and turn the handle further. I got in the shower, but when I got out. The water was turned on full blast. After that, I started getting ready faster in the mornings, so I didn't have to be in the house. One morning, my mom was still home, so I decided to take my time getting ready. When I was in the shower, I could clearly hear my step father saying hello to me. I didn't get the terrified feeling I normally got. Instead I was filled with joy. The last thing that happened in that house before we moved happened around 3 am. I was working late shift, so it was common that I would be cooking at these times. As I was waiting on the oven to heat up, the coffee pot came on without anyone touching it. Now, some might think it could have been set like an alarm, but no one in my house drinks coffee. It was my step father's, so I went to investigate and the coffee pot wasn't even plugged in. Finally, this brings me to the present. My mother went to the beach, but I stayed home because I had to work. One night, I heard growling coming from my living room, but both dogs were in bed with me. There was nothing in the house to make that sound. I closed my bedroom door and laid in bed, until I couldn't stay awake anymore. I was ecstatic when Mom came home the next day. Finally, last night, the thing that made me post my story. I was going to get ready for work, so I walked through the house to get a towel. When I came back through, my mom asked what I was doing. I told her going to shower for work. She looked at me confused and said she thought I had already showered. She heard it running. My mom and I are the only ones in the house. I went to the bathroom to check out her claim. Nothing was out of place, no running water. I still didn't shower that night. Please, tell me what is following my family and why it only affects me.

s_1846_53,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"Afraid to go to the hospital, Afraid to go to work, One has to happen. This will be a messy post, I'm sure. Running on very little sleep the past few days. Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all. It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place. I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions. I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills. I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason. I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before). I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job. So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable. I am not sure what to do.",I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today.,4619,5,1

s_1831_20,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,"Everything I know is going upside down. I can't take it anymore. I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and ""fun"" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then. Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing ""the right thing"" and that everything was going to be better now. What a fucking liar. After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of ""the best of the best"". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to ""become healthier"" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house. Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were ""incapable and horrible at raising us"". Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night.

s_1831_20,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Everything I know is going upside down. I can't take it anymore. I've been dealing with this crap for a while now, and I've been fairly silent about it until now. Flashback to 8th grade, May 2013. I had everything going for me. I was in high classes for the majority of my courses, just got accepted into the National Junior Honor Society, plenty of friends, a plan for the future, and a loving family. I had some procrastination issues, but otherwise I was an A/B student. Then I got the news that my grandma was sent to the hospital, and the outcome was, most likely, death. I took it badly, shaking and crying. My grandma and grandpa were like a second home for me, I went there after school and did work there, played with their dogs, and had a lot of good memories over there. The idea of not seeing her anymore was devastating, and I was using it to push myself further to make her proud. I finished the year with a high GPA, got into high classes for my freshman year and continued to do things I loved. A slight addiction to Nintendo and the (then-upcoming) Smash Bros. for Wii U helped push through and give me something to look forward to. As the time went by, my grandma went from near-death to surviving. A few amputations on her leg later, she bounced from nursing home to nursing home. Grandpa, meanwhile, stayed at their house with the dogs, taking care of it and such, a lot more carefree and ""fun"" than usual. We'd visit him often, mostly over the weekends, and we'd also go to the nursing home every other night or so to see my grandma. While she remained the person I loved, I saw a more bitter side to her. She was constantly whining about how she's trapped here, and I always felt guilty, for no real reason. I'd led to her getting injuries when I was little, but it wasn't what she was struggling with then. Time went by, little by little, soon freshman year was almost over. I had finished with decent grades, as was expected, and had made a lot of new friends, alongside signing up for AP European History and such. Then came the phone call that changed my life. I was sitting at home, sick from school, both parents at work and my little brother at school. I got a call from my grandma, still in her nursing home, about two weeks from her release back home to resume normal life. She was in tears, asking for my mom. When I told her they were at work, she began to cry harder. I had no idea what was happening, and had to ask what had happened. Apparently, my grandpa had just called her. He was divorcing her. Before I could call my mom, grandpa called. He ranted about how he was doing ""the right thing"" and that everything was going to be better now. What a fucking liar. After having to call both mom and dad to explain what was happening, I couldn't do anything but sit there and cry. I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do. Once they got home and settled me down, my mom made the decision to help my grandma move into her house, and stay with her for a few weeks to help get her back into where she used to be. My sole mission was to keep my little brother out of the action, and ensure he wasn't affected by any of the bullcrap that was happening. Yet, there was a huge part of me that was trying to fix things. The family was falling apart, and people were constantly yelling and freaking out. I was left in the middle, trying to solve things that I now know was impossible. As time passed, my brother and I (and our dog) moved in with mom and grandma, as weeks became about 2 months. We'd stay there for a while until grandma was capable of living on her own. Nurse visits, trips to the hospital, screaming phone arguments, everything was just guilting me even more. I became more involved online through Smashboards (a Smash Bros. forum), made friends there, got really high in the ranks and became part of a group of ""the best of the best"". People really liked me there, it was an escape from the life I was beginning to fear. Fanfictions, video games, developing video games, speculating them, I was engulfed in this world and slowly leaving my own. Truths began to unravel. My grandpa had been cheating on my grandma since my mom got pregnant with me. Trips to the gym, attempts to ""become healthier"" were all a ruse to impress this other woman. We found porn, condoms, lube, the whole nine yards in the house. Soon, we went from a 2-week stay to the entire summer, with our bus routes picking us up at my grandma's place. I started our sophomore year pretty well, with the exception of AP Euro, which I couldn't focus in. Managed a 3.0 GPA by end of first semester. Home life, on the other hand, was terrible. Constant fights, dealing with grandpa's shit, the constant barking of her dogs, who went from being adorable playmates to terrorizing little shits, etc. At one point, my grandpa tried to take us to court and get custody over me and my brother, as my parents were ""incapable and horrible at raising us"". Now, sophomore year is nearly over. I am failing nearly all of my classes. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I'm taking 20mg of anti-depressants each night.

He helps me but he has a social life; he has friends and enjoys meeting new people- unlike me who feels overwhelmed around more than 2 people at a time. And now when he hangs out at night, I feel like hes only proving how much of a lifeless and worthless thing I am. Im not fucking controlling or attention seeking, I just cant understand how Im supposed continue living being this alone. How long could someone go without any friends ?

s_2958_25,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,"I don't have aspergers or adhd, but the symptoms caused by PTSD are very similar to those diagnoses. My parents weren't abusive, (though my mother could be emotionally I suppose) but they are serious professional types and were very emotionally neglectful. My family moved around a lot and I was left with a series of unstable babysitters, and was bullied severely by other kids. I started dissociating and dealing with that by just distracting myself with hobbies and pop culture. I had really deep knowledge in things like history and literature from a young age because I used those things to occupy myself from strong emotions and dissociation. These interests might have looked like ""autistic interests"", but they weren't, they were some mix of stress and being above average intelligence. I had anger problems and seriously over reacted to things through my preteen/early teen years, which definitly could have been mistaken for the ""meltdowns"" people with aspergers have. I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress. Blank stares and not being able to identify your own emotions are common symptoms for PTSD and Aspergers. All these things made it difficult for me to build relationships with other kids growing up. Not being in touch with my own emotions, dissociation, poor self-image, chronic escapism, anxiety and depression are all things I have to deal with because of my PTSD.","I had problems with concentration, but that was probably a mix of dissociation and stress.",979,7,1

First of all: I am a university student on weekends and I am doing a full time job on weekdays. I am in my mid twenties. I still live with my parents and I don't own any vehicle of my own. The usual length of the university degree I am following is 4 years, and this is my 6th year, because I still have failed subjects and I am trying to retake them and graduate as soon as possible. The job I work on does not suit me, I mean I am bored and I seldom feel interested in the work I do. Why do I still hang around in the job? It pays me (considerably lower than the usual pay but it still pays something) and I want to be independent of my parents. They have paid for my university degree too, and I feel like I should take care of my expenses by myself. I am scared that I'd be a burnout, because I am bored to death of everything in my life. I feel that I have more than one mental health issue: anxiety, depression most likely, and OCD, ADHD(or ADD) and possibly Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Also, I believe I am addicted to porn and social media and junk food. Let me explain the rationale behind my conclusions. Anxiety and depression: Pretty sure, because I often am nervous when carrying out even the simplest tasks and interacting with others (even my family members), and I love my comfort zones like my bed and my room and I feel uneasy whenever I have to leave them. I feel overwhelmed among crowds and I tend to avoid crowded places. It's kinda funny, because I have a thing for singing, and it usually requires performing in front of a crowd. I have done it very few times, and needless to say, I felt very anxious and hard to perform. I cannot handle pressure, especially when there are deadlines. Though I think this is related to ADHD as well. I think I have depression because I am sad most of the time. It's just I don't see many reasons to be happy about in my life right now. I tend to overthink even the smallest and silliest things, and then the end goal is feeling distraught. I spend a lot of time on Social media or daydreaming or sleeping because I feel bored by my university work and office work. I lack enthusiasm to do even the daily tasks like taking a shower or brushing teeth. OCD : I have a habit of repetition of things, washing my hands a lot and checking out if the door is locked immediately after I've locked the door, I feel the need of organizing trivial things. When I see my room unorganized, it really bugs me. So I think this conclusion is pretty justified. I have an acne issue on my skin and I cannot stop myself from picking on scabs and I believe OCD is one of the reasons that I cannot get rid of acne. ADHD or ADD : This one I recently got to know. I have issues in focusing and attention. I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long. if a tas requires a lot of organizing, I spend a lot of time getting ready for that and sometimes try to avoid it altogether. I get easily distracted by surroundings and sometimes my own thoughts. I often doze off in group conversations, this has become a big problem because this happens a lot in office video calls and I don't remember what topics were discussed during the call. I suck at time management and prioritizing my work. I can be forgetful. Bipolar : I have rapid mood swings; one second I'm happy and the next I'm not. I get irritated easily, for simple to no reasons. Sometimes I am really energized up and sometimes I'm lethargic. Sometimes I can talk with someone else for more than one hour and sometimes I don't feel like talking at all. BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) : I feel like either I have more than one personality or I have none whatsoever. I find my interests vary from time to time: for example sometimes I feel like I love football, and sometimes I don't find it very exciting. I have different kinds of thoughts and feelings and they can change rather quickly. So are my interests. I feel like a lot of debate going inside my head on different topics. Maybe this isn't actually BPD. A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed. I still get them from time to time. I sometimes feel like I am not afraid of death anymore (I used to be scared of death all the time), as long as the way of dying is painless and quick, it's just I have stopped worrying about afterlife. Main reason I am still staying here is that I have a responsibility to my family and I have to take care of them, otherwise I would have actually turned this off long ago. I have seen this thing called cycles when expressing depression, which I haven't really experienced. It's like my whole life recently has been one big singular cycle which never ends. Social media addiction : I use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit and I spend a lot of time surfing through them and I cannot control it. Porn addiction : I usually watch porn and masturbate at least once a day and I feel like it's affecting my sleep cycle. My sleep cycle is in disarray. Junk food : Perhaps this is stress eating. I cannot go by myself for a few hours without having a snack or some junk food or a drink (Non alcoholic). I find it incredibly difficult to tackle with 1 of them, because something else from the above list can intervene and make it harder. I once met a psychologist or a psychiatrist and I tried to explain the whole thing to him, but he dismissed my claims and I felt really really hurt after that. I mean I have already paid, why couldn't he listen to me? Because of that, and for obvious anxiety reasons, I find it hard to actually meet a psychiatrist again.

It pays me (considerably lower than the usual pay but it still pays something) and I want to be independent of my parents. They have paid for my university degree too, and I feel like I should take care of my expenses by myself. I am scared that I'd be a burnout, because I am bored to death of everything in my life. I feel that I have more than one mental health issue: anxiety, depression most likely, and OCD, ADHD(or ADD) and possibly Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Also, I believe I am addicted to porn and social media and junk food. Let me explain the rationale behind my conclusions. Anxiety and depression: Pretty sure, because I often am nervous when carrying out even the simplest tasks and interacting with others (even my family members), and I love my comfort zones like my bed and my room and I feel uneasy whenever I have to leave them. I feel overwhelmed among crowds and I tend to avoid crowded places. It's kinda funny, because I have a thing for singing, and it usually requires performing in front of a crowd. I have done it very few times, and needless to say, I felt very anxious and hard to perform. I cannot handle pressure, especially when there are deadlines. Though I think this is related to ADHD as well. I think I have depression because I am sad most of the time. It's just I don't see many reasons to be happy about in my life right now. I tend to overthink even the smallest and silliest things, and then the end goal is feeling distraught. I spend a lot of time on Social media or daydreaming or sleeping because I feel bored by my university work and office work. I lack enthusiasm to do even the daily tasks like taking a shower or brushing teeth. OCD : I have a habit of repetition of things, washing my hands a lot and checking out if the door is locked immediately after I've locked the door, I feel the need of organizing trivial things. When I see my room unorganized, it really bugs me. So I think this conclusion is pretty justified. I have an acne issue on my skin and I cannot stop myself from picking on scabs and I believe OCD is one of the reasons that I cannot get rid of acne. ADHD or ADD : This one I recently got to know. I have issues in focusing and attention. I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long. if a tas requires a lot of organizing, I spend a lot of time getting ready for that and sometimes try to avoid it altogether. I get easily distracted by surroundings and sometimes my own thoughts. I often doze off in group conversations, this has become a big problem because this happens a lot in office video calls and I don't remember what topics were discussed during the call. I suck at time management and prioritizing my work. I can be forgetful. Bipolar : I have rapid mood swings; one second I'm happy and the next I'm not. I get irritated easily, for simple to no reasons. Sometimes I am really energized up and sometimes I'm lethargic. Sometimes I can talk with someone else for more than one hour and sometimes I don't feel like talking at all. BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) : I feel like either I have more than one personality or I have none whatsoever. I find my interests vary from time to time: for example sometimes I feel like I love football, and sometimes I don't find it very exciting. I have different kinds of thoughts and feelings and they can change rather quickly. So are my interests. I feel like a lot of debate going inside my head on different topics. Maybe this isn't actually BPD. A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed. I still get them from time to time. I sometimes feel like I am not afraid of death anymore (I used to be scared of death all the time), as long as the way of dying is painless and quick, it's just I have stopped worrying about afterlife. Main reason I am still staying here is that I have a responsibility to my family and I have to take care of them, otherwise I would have actually turned this off long ago. I have seen this thing called cycles when expressing depression, which I haven't really experienced. It's like my whole life recently has been one big singular cycle which never ends. Social media addiction : I use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit and I spend a lot of time surfing through them and I cannot control it. Porn addiction : I usually watch porn and masturbate at least once a day and I feel like it's affecting my sleep cycle. My sleep cycle is in disarray. Junk food : Perhaps this is stress eating. I cannot go by myself for a few hours without having a snack or some junk food or a drink (Non alcoholic).

s_1514_213,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"The Grey Riders [Part Three] I choose to daringly forego a mere sip and lift the lid and straw to take three deeply satisfying gulps of my soda. Its not something you can do more than once or twice at a movie without draining the cup and risking a bathroom break during something important, but Im in the mood to to sink with a smile into sense-filling sweetness. As the rolling flavor fades from my senses, I sigh with contentment. The older man to my right looks on with slightly wide eyes. I really thought that trailer had spoiled the end of the movie. Touching my cheek, I trace an old scar that I always liked to think healed in the shape of a black holes halo. It hadnt been there a moment ago, but the round bullet hole and two pointed corners where it had been stitched shut had collectively graced my left cheek for years; Id only just noticed and remembered. What, that girl shooting up through her own face to escape? Nah, they wouldnt end a movie like that. Not flashy enough. He nods with understanding, if not agreement. Glancing left, I notice one of my friends to the left of Tacitus. His hair is blood red and his skin is pale under the shifting light of the screen. I ask with excitement. When did you get here? He must not hear me over the noise and thunder of the previews; like Tacitus, he gazes unmoving at the picture. This must be a very safe place to you, the man says. Still smiling, I turn back to address him. Special, absolutely. I laugh with nostalgia. The bi-lustrum had just come, and among the movies they blasted to us was a little film that had missed the last one by barely a week. Can you believe that? It was released in the Empire four days after, which meant we didnt get to see it until *ten years* later. Oh, it would have changed everything about our own cinema. He matches my smile with a kind one of his own. It was that good? More than you know. I think back. It took the military caste by storm. My grandfather let me go see it on a school trip; some sort of special field trip just for the military kids. I focus on the screen as images of Imperial Legate Blue appear just as I remember. Countless rows of smartly-dressed children salute him on his high tapestried station as he salutes back, jokes with Imperial Legate Red whose face is on a nearby screen, and then introduces the movie. I grin wickedly. Nineteen-eighty-six. Already ten years old by the time we saw it, but it was absolutely timeless. Ah, yes... an instant classic. I ask, Youve seen it? For some reason, I had vaguely expected that he had not. Something about his manner hints that he is a foreigner; perhaps he is from another continent. He does not answer. His slightly crooked nose throws random shadows across his face as he turns his gaze around the theater. So this place is special to you, but not safe? Shaking my head, I look up into the vast dark void above. The ceiling is black, but visible; definitely present, but still high and distant. When the movie actually starts, Im thankful, for it absorbs my full attention and pulls me somewhere else. Here in the dark, in the long minutes before it begins, I feel reversed. I am as a spider clinging to the ceiling above an infinite and unknowable depth full of icy chills, absolute silence, and utter loneliness. He follows my gaze upward and replies solemnly, I see. In the current preview being shown, a lost little girl reaches for her mothers hand in the forested night, but her mother has vanished, and she is alone. I look away from both the darkness above and the moving light ahead. After an uncomfortable moment resisting some unknown chill, I continue. Anyway, it was a double feature. Predator and Die Hard, back to back, and no school at all. That was the best day *ever.* That sounds wonderful. It must have deeply affected you, being surrounded by children your age all boisterous and full of camaraderie after a day of pure on-screen bravado. Laughing, I said, More than you know. I really needed that feeling. Genuinely compassionate, he asks, How many weeks before had your parents been exiled? A rising choir of screams emanates from the trailer that has now been placed upon our screen. That same actress from the first trailer with the distinctive wound in her left cheek is now in another upcoming movie; here she clings to the inner top of a well while her world begins undergoing a Dimensional Rotation. I laugh heartily. Oh man, not this cliche again. This is like the tenth movie to use that plot device. Dont they know the Legates would *never* do something so absurdly drastic? Its just not believable! And does this movie even have a makeup department? It looks like shes still exhausted from that other movie! Passed out, in fact... I trail off as I began to feel strangely uncomfortable. He gives a kindly worried grimace. She really does need to wake up. Her friends cant hold her ankles much longer. Someone opens a door behind us in the theater. Light streams in, blinding me. Someone else opens an emergency exit door. Wind from outside roars in, throwing my hair about wildly as my face hits the back of the seat in front of me. Combat skills and determination won't be enough to survive this! he shouts in my ear. Think it through! What does a Dimensional Rotation do? Breathing becomes incredibly hard, and I gasp; indeed, it was the outward rush of air and drop in pressure that had momentarily knocked the girl in the preview unconscious in the first place. Theyre literally *turning the planet,* I tell him, gripping the seats in an effort not to be torn up and away into the black. Rotating... local spacetime. It wont make the holes go away... but it will change where they go...
Thereby cutting off your enemy, he yells. Smart tactic! ""Smart..."" I can only barely manage a whisper as the battering gale tears all presence from my lungs. Except for this part...
Consciousness returned in a disorienting instant. Grabbing jutting stones instinctively as I upended, I stared up into a long circular darkness where dozens of terrified people hung like so many wide-eyed spiders staring down at me. The closest was a dirt-covered and gritted face at the shoulder end of a straining arm. How was Flavia above me? If the well was up, then down waswe had just been talking about my greatest fear, a secret born within me from my vulnerable youthful years, and that animal terror reared up just outside my awareness
*Don't look down!* Flavia shouted something, but I couldn't hear her over the deafening winds holding me aloft. *don't look down*
The turbulent gale was so powerful that the mud had been stripped from her hair. *don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down*
In a wide arc, the blonde halo danced chaotically around her head like the Medusa of old. *don'tlookdowndon'tlookdowndon'tlookdown*
Indeed, the full realization of my situation turned me to stone as I saw the reflected tint of the skies augmenting that blue already present in her eyes. There was nothing but open void below waiting to swallow me; light and windy rather than dark and silent, but void nevertheless. The paralysis of that childhood terror took me, and I slipped from her grasp in an eternally long moment of mutual shocked stares and flailing hands. A single sharp violin note in my heart slowed time to infinity, but there was nothing for it. DownI was sinkingdown! no!a millimeter an eon, but it was already too late. As I sank into a deeper current, that long violin note faded in favor of the wind's all-encompassing roar, and the well in the ceiling of the world shrank at a startling pace. As I curved away from it, I saw Flavia leap forth; where she had once considered giving up by falling in, she was now jumping out of that same well and off of that same ledge with the fire of life. A gripping fist slammed me into earth, and I bounced and flipped over fully once before grabbing at dirt with my fingers. Momentarily flat, I turned my face up against the hot wind and looked a planetary crisis in the eyes. Dirt soared at me like an endless plane of flowing dust; only buildings, trees, and the distant well stood against it. The clouds were unrecognizable speeding tracts of jagged white on tempestuous blue racing by overhead. Indeed, if I understood right, the atmosphere would be the first thing to feel the effects of the Rotationit was the least anchored and the most mobile, and was far heavier by mass than anyone usually gave it credit for. All around the world, the entire atmosphere had begun to move all at once, and that initial maelstrom had torn Rufus away, and then me. From what I'd seen in the movies, there would be a small lull after the chaos ebbed; after the air stopped tripping on itself and began moving smoothly in concert, but before it began picking up real speed. That moment would be my only chance. And I was so tired. My fingers held all of my remaining strength, and employed it fully to dig into grass and loam. The wind grew warmer as the energy being expended found sink in the atmosphere; I gasped against dirt and dust to breathe. My outward sigh of pain coincided with a quieting breeze as the moment approached, and I tried to climb to my kneesbut failed. Firm hands pulled me up by my forearm, and I tried again, this time succeeding. Flavia pushed forward against the wind alongside me, and even spoke words of determination, but I could not hear her over the whisper turning into dragon's breath around us. It was different this time. No longer were there curling currents of chaos curving this way and that through the woods and ways of our world; the gale was now unified, constant, and rising. Often with storms there is an innate apprehension as one awaits the ebb of a particular blast, and keening adrenaline as it rises higher and higher, suggesting the idea that *this one might just keep getting stronger*I felt that adrenaline, for I knew this force would not stop. She and I ran forward together stumbling; walked together; pushed and shouted against a flat palm of brutal force at the last; fell flat and clutched the earth again mere steps from the well as the roar grew beyond deafening, the vibration of the ground shook us to our core, and the sheer force began peeling us away from our handholds. There were only two planes now, both opaque, smooth, and blazing past. One was dull brown and one was bright blue, but they both screamed doom. I kept my head up and my eyes and mouth turned away, but like a powerful ocean current that I had somehow sunk into up to my elbows, the brown pulled past with unstoppable strength. My fingers finally let go. I hear you again, playing that distant violin, for I am about to die. I know this. I do not accept it, but I know it. There can be no surviving this speed, this sheer kinetic energy, and I tumble half in that flat brown plane and half out, breathing in the scant instants I can before hitting the earth again and again. If I could just *see*, I might try to
The pain hits beyond belief, but somewhere far away where I can barely feel it. I am back in the movie theater again for a brief lapse; the man with the crooked nose stands over me in concern as I lay crumpled between the seats. I'm not sure why, but I need to know. I ask desperately, ""Is Flavia here?"" He looks left for a moment, and then smiles and shakes his head. "" Heaving awake, I pushed at the encompassing pressure crushing every limb. Metal rods and massive broken foundations jutted around me, but something marginally softer had prevented my impalement. Turning my head, I saw who I had landed against. The rods had stabbed into he who had traveled upon this path first, and thus his last act had been to save my life one more time. His broken arm had twisted and remained at an angle, leaving him in a permanent state of salute. I didn't have the breath to tell him, but Rufus knew I was thankful. The heated atmospheric impetus reached the force and constancy of a jet engine aimed directly at me, and I crawled deeper into the rubble to escape being torn away. Among the heavy walls, I entered under the wordless screaming gazes of a dozen others who had already secured themselves here. Tied to rods or wedged between stones, they held on with their all and prepared for what was comingfor the spherical globe-spanning hurricane was merely the beginning. They could see my uniform. Children looked at me and grew calm. Mothers nodded with silent thanks. Fathers clenched their fists in determination. Was Iwas my mere presence
I was a symbol. Not only was it necessary that I survive, I had to look calm and confident, too. As my ears adjusted to the eerily constant breath of the world-dragon around us, all became silent. Here in the broken pits that had once been the foundation of a building, I could breathe, and I let myself do so as the whining of the sirens broke through the deafening blanket. The alarms had been built to be heard even under these conditions, loud beyond belief, and we listened to their long shrill dirges now. To say that I was utterly terrified beyond the limits of insanity would have been an understatement, but I just gazed at a young girl who had been tied to a foundation stone by her mother. If I wasn't scared, then she wasn't scared. If she wasn't scared, then I wasn't scared. Think it through, he'd said. All I had was my belt. As the world itself trembled from the sheer ferocity of wind overhead, I tied my belt first around three rods, and then my wrist. Heart pounding in horrified anticipation, I sent my senses down to my core. Could I feel it? It was starting. What did I know about the Rotation? Something about reference frames, inertia, a minimum level of static friction and potential energythey hadn't taught us about it in depth because nobody had expected the deeper capabilities of our artificial Earth to ever actually be employed. There was something, too, about frame dragging and the computational inclusions of the massive bio-computers hooked into the core of the planet. The ground itself and any buildings, rooted trees, and other heavy stationary objects would remain anchored, but absolutely everything loose or mobile would notpeople included. Staring, I watched the little silver dolphin at the end of the girl's necklace begin to rise. A slight dizziness and disorientation washed over me; underneath us, the grey rubble began to take on the feeling of tilting. I expected them to, but nobody screamed. All eyes were on me. Adjusting my footing repeatedly as the tilt became steeper and smaller rocks began tumbling away, I did my best to appear confident. I even said some platitude I had once heard the Chief repeat. Despite being unable to hear a single thing over the jet engine that was our atmosphere, parents nodded. My gaze turned to the mother's hand on that little girl's. No, the terror only became real once the dirt and rubble were sliding away in earnest and we had to fight to keep standing. A thirty-degree incline, and then thirty-five, and then fortyat forty-five degrees, something changed in my perception, and I no longer perceived myself to be on a steepening hill. Instead, it was a cliff becoming progressively more shallow. Now they screamed, for they could not help it. Children cried as they slipped and fell and became tangled in their ropes; fathers strained their arms and mothers tied knots ever tighter. Their eyes were upon me no longer, for this was now a time of personal survival and nothing else. That part of me that begged for a larger entity than myself to *do something* screamed loudly in my thoughts as my boots scrabbled away from the tilting earth for the final time and I began truly hanging from my tied belt. Now my brain processed the fiery winds for what they were: all around the globe, above every city and valley and mountain, the skies were literally fallingit just so happened that, because of the Rotation, down was becoming horizontal rather than vertical. Like a roundabout that I had often played on as a child, once it began spinning, the imaginary force that appeared when our reference frame was in rotation became the dominant pull. Centrifugal, I told myself, squeezing my eyes shut. I was not hanging over an endless pit; I was being held horizontal by centrifugal force. The logic wasn't enough to override the fear. Opening my eyes again, I stared down past my feet. I was hanging next to an infinite cliff, and only ledges, trees, and buildings stuck out below to break my falland my body. To my left, a father's rope came untied, and I watched him sail down into the distance only to splatter and bounce from the side of some distant wall. Worse, ragdolls were flying through the air around us, and I saw many nearby hangers-on turn away in horror as they soared past and became bright red blotches on brick ledges, rocks, and trees far below. How far would it go? That desperate terror struck me again as I thought of the force continuing to tilt and throwing me straight up into the sky, but it stopped directly at horizontal as the full weight of the Rotation turned spacetime beneath the very fabric of our existence. Shuddering and weak from all that I had been through, I let the belt choke my wrist into numbness. I could not hold on, but the pain was better than falling even if I lost a hand. The sirens cut off one by one, but not because the danger was past. I flinched as a falling car snapped off the alarm tower visible on the horizon. Thousands of logs followed, a storm with wood instead of raindrops, and the foundation above me shook tremendously at the impacts. Multiple logs hit each other, and one bounced in and crushed a child and half a father hanging some measure below me. How much more could we take?! * What would be left of us even if we survived this?!* The heat of our raging blacksmith's furnace grew unbearable, and I thought I actually saw a trunk or two burst into flames as they impacted one another. There was no longer any sound, for the overwhelming reverberation of the rushing ocean of air falling past us had left me with nothing but auditory numbness. Pieces of my uniform were being torn away by their frayed or sliced ends; I could feel the belt squeezing the bones of my wrist into horrible bruising. It was as if the hand of some entity of kinetic energy had gripped me bodily and begun to squeeze and pull, and it only grew more intent as a truck slammed into the stone above. It was going to crack. I could sense it. I could also see it in the eyes of those far from me who could see up past the overhang at what I could not. Had my hands rested enough? I didn't have a choice. Gripping the jutting metal rods, I fought the crushing fist that held my body in thrall. I just needed enough to undo the belt, and thenthe pain! Screaming mentally as the feeling rushed back into my hand, I dove headlong into the nerve-fire and gripped the next rod over with fingers I couldn't even feel. It wasn't enough. The wrenching forces snapped me down with vehemence, and I shot past my startled companions in the blink of an eye. There was no longer any fear. Now that I was falling along with the wind, vehicles, logs the grey wave had thrown about, and even other people, I felt hardly anything at all. The wind was lesser, for I was at speed, and nothing was hitting me, for we were all soaring together. Curiously, the divorcing of action from ability left me completely calm. There were no objects in reach, I had no strength left, and there was no way to communicate. I could do nothing. Therefore, I was no longer afraid. Fear existed to motivate necessary actions, I realized, and without possible actions I was merely an observer. My fate was in the hands of Luck or Fate or Chance personified now. At the very least, this was a beautiful experience. The eternal cliff to one side whipped past, full of buildings and rubble and broken forests seen in a way no human being had ever experienced before. On the other side, layers upon layers of the sky moved with me, a graceful ocean walling me off from space. I would not be cast out into that icy cold void alone like I had feared as a child; even at its most injured, my Earth would hold me tight and protect me from that fate. How high was I? Two, maybe three stories up? I was lucky most suburban buildings had been destroyed. New Rome approached like so many flat spikes below, shooting out far from the eternal cliff even at this perspective. Would one of those buildings be my end? Falling around me, I saw a white-haired old man, an unconscious brunette woman, andno! The little girl! She was above me, but falling fasterwhy? * Less air resistance? A different current? She screamed mightily with abject terror, but there was nobody to hear her. I pointed at the old man and then at her, and he saw her approaching. Would he understand? He tried to grab her, but, failing that, pushed her my way. We were skydiving. Wait, junior year we'd trained for this! It had only been the one time, and just as part of a cooperative educational effort with the army, but we *had* done this. Suddenly back in a type of situation I understood, I used what felt like permanent blasting air jets to move myself closer. My arms closed around her, and I gripped her tight. Her silver dolphin necklace tried to spirit itself away, but I grabbed it on impulse. The girl clutched my midsection tight, and I looked past her at the old man, who had emulated me in moving with the air and grabbing the unconscious woman. Look downbuildings growing largerwhat had our speed been skydiving? By military reckon, a league and a half per minute, which meant two miles a minuteand we'd started near Collis Oppidumsomewhere in my training, I had learned to keep track of the time even in crisis. Alrightwe had ninety seconds. I used one hand to hold the girl against me and the other to grab the old man as he floated within range. He was likely military or engineering caste, for he understood what was needed. Together, we scanned the storm of debris around us for anything that might act to slow our rate of descent. It was he who saw ita massive tarp whipping around the contents of a long flatbed truck loaded with pipes. We angled our four bodies and moved toward it, but we dared not accelerate too fast and injure ourselves upon it. The wait was beyond excruciating. I let the girl go and she clasped the side of the truck and held on. I mouthed, *I'll be back*, and she nodded tearfully. The old man climbed his way down with the woman in tow; tying her to the back of the cabin, he let her hang limp in the wind, for there was little else he could do. Time was up. We three conscious passengers on the side of the falling truck clenched against the coming impact as the broken teeth of New Rome came up to meet us with all their yawning broken glass windows and exposed interconnecting structural supports. They had been built to withstand this kind of disaster, and withstand they had; cars, trucks, logs, boulders, and people smashed into them, but their armored cores and reinforced network of strutsusually hidden behind colorful banners or artfully blue to avoid sticking outnow took every impact without so much as a shiver. It was at one of these angled buttresses we shotand passed within an arm's length. Looking up, I stared for a single heartbeat at the receding spikes above. We had somehow hit the bullseye and soared right through; the buildings had taken a ton of the debris out of the air around us, for that matter. I looked down to the old man and mouthed, *Let's go!* He nodded and began untying the forward section of the tarp. I climbed higher and untied as I went, replacing the knots with a cinch around my own waist. We would have to do this right if we were to use this tarp correctly. Looking down, I confirmed that he had done the same for himself and the little girl at the proper points. All we could do was create a curve in the huge tarp with our own weight and hope that the wind kept it full; we had no time or materials for a proper parachute. Even as we worked, the tilt began softening. We kept the important points tied so that it would not flap in the wind until we were ready, but, as I reached for my knife, they began snapping one by one. He had been going for her, but the now-conscious woman in the cabin stared at us through the window as we were pulled roughly away. As we three slammed together like pendulums and held tight, we could do nothing but watch her drop down into the distance with the truck. *Away,* the old man indicated, pointing into the sky. Debris was our enemy now, more so than a potential fall. We did our best by pulling on the tarp ropes to direct ourselves away from the eternal cliff and its limitless continuum of debris; over the course of countless heartbeats, the Rotation began slowing and the tilt in the world faded. We ourselves rotated with it, and our feet came to point at the racing ground. There was nothing else to do but take the impact. I tried to run as the speeding earth came up to meet us, but it was just too fast. Random debris continued to fall as we lay on our backs in that upturned field and stared up at the sky. He had broken a leg, and I had broken an arm, but the little girl between us remained unharmed. Of the detritus arcing to earth like falling stars, I sighted numerous black spheres. Stumbling over flattened high grass and kicking one, I found it to be undamaged, but lifeless. The intelligence behind its operation had been cut off by the Dimensional Rotation exactly as the Legates had hoped. Our world had still been shotgunned with holes to other realities by some unknown damage, but we were no longer directly connected to wherever that particular enemy resided. There were no words. Dirt-blasted, limping, injured, and in shock, we three began the long walk back to the city. Ashen ghosts joined us one or two at a time, and what was left of the road became a trail of silent tears lined by the remains of both people and civilization. The heat generated by the Rotation had not left us, and we walked on into the searing night without relief. But we had survived. We had lived through it. By training and action, we had survived the forceful turning of our entire planet and the spacetime around it, just as our forefathers had intended when they had grown the Amber Worlds in the first placewell, not exactly. The ability was supposed to have been used for restructuring the branches and support of the outer Shield, and we were *supposed* to have months or even years to prepare. With only sixty seconds' warning, we had undoubtedly lost a tremendous fraction of our way of life. All vehicles had basically been destroyed, as well as any structures not built to military code, and everyone who had not heard the sirens or who had not found secure attachment in less than a minute. There were no words to describe the losses. Worse was the general understanding that the Empire would not be coming to help us. We who had lived at the core of the Shielded worlds had had our own protections stripped away; what likelihood was it that *they* were still alive? The First World, maybe, for it had its own powerful barrier, but none of us thought for a second that the rest of the Empire had survived whatever had happened. Indeed, through every little window in space as we walked, we saw only strangeness and nightmare. The squat high towers of New Rome exhibited an array of vehicles and other buildings sticking out from one side; the other, while hardly pristine with all those broken windows, stood as a testament to the fact that we were still here. Most of the survivors in our thousand-odd walkers from the outer areas had been military or engineering caste. Arriving at midnight sweaty and drained shells of our former selves, as a group we began picking things up and cleaning. It took an arriving Legate to order us to stand down and go recuperate before it really hit us that we had been through something so devastating that our way of lifeour very work ethicneeded to take a back seat for the moment. For me, it felt like Caecilia's order for us to go home all over again. Twice in the same day I had been told that I had reached the limits of my duty and that I should go home to see my friends and family. The feeling was... jarring. ""I'll get her to the Coordination Center and find her parents,"" my ally in parachuting told me. I gripped his arm and said in the formal, ""Good serving with you."" He saluted, and I knew then that he was military caste, not engineering. Part of me swelled with a little bit of pride as I watched him lead that little girl into the crowd. What devastation the strange grey wave had brought had since been dropped away by the Rotation, and I limped along clear roads and fields that had once been forests. Lone trees remained where once whole groves had stood; the wave had felled them, and the eternal cliff had sent them soaring to distant lands. At first I wondered why we lacked debris from those lands higher than us, but then I came upon the remains of the ocean as it lay pooled to the horizon. I stood in thrall then, filled with adrenaline once more, as I envisioned the tipping of the very ocean itself down the face of our lands. Beyond the second level of human endurance and deep into a third that stemmed from my very soul, I found enough energy to run home as the powerful beats of my favorite movies pounded action and music in my head. But my home had been on the main hill of Collis Oppidum, and the falling seas had swept around it. By dawn's light, I staggered up to buildings I had once thought matchstick; my heart swelled and my head filled with crescendos of triumph. A few others had fallen, but my home still stood. Kicking open the door, I again found our two rooms calm and organized; my grandfather had already cleaned up and made our apartment presentable. He sat within, drinking tea with a dozen others from the wellmy brothers and sisters included. Flavia was the first one up, and her arms held me tight. As the others rushed close, I fell to my knees and sobbed with happiness. I had no thoughts, only joy and wonder and relief, and my gaze remained locked upon the silver dolphin and chain that had become tangled around my bruised wrist. ""You're quite dirty,"" my grandfather said warmly from beyond the huddle of cheer and clasping arms. "" What have I told you about coming in the house as such? Go clean off."" ""I will,"" I told him, laughing despite the pain of my broken arm, open cheek, exposed temple, bruised wrist, utter exhaustion, and numerous other little injuries. "" I will..."" Calm sleep found me as I slumped there on the floor surrounded by my family, and I let it overtake me. There were no dreams. I wanted no thoughts, no pain, and no adrenaline. I wanted resting blackness, and I was given it. I awoke in a sweat and at the ready, but with my arm in a cast, my cheek sewn up, my temple bandaged, and a compress on my wrist. There was no enemy to fight and no disaster coming; shivering, I lowered back onto my bed and stared at the ceiling the same way I had stared up at the sky after finally coming to light with our makeshift parachute. Was it really over? ""It's been three days. You're quite the layabout,"" my grandfather commented with a smile as he came over and patted a cloth on my forehead. "" How are you feeling?"" I tried to speak, but the words seized in my throat. Flashes of everything I had been through choked my heart, and I went through that blasting wave, that ancient house, Titus' empty eyes, the battles with the spheres, the horrifying winds, Rufus' final salute, the man and his child crushed by a bouncing log, the endless fall, and that woman staring at us out of the cabin of the truck all over again. I could only sob with all of my being. He held me against his chest. "" Fear not, granddaughter. You come from tough stock. You will be finein time."" It took another three days before I managed to stand on weak and trembling legs. Finding the mirror above our water bowl, I studied my cheek and forehead. The bullet hole had been made by the small caliber round of my police pistol, but it was still noticeable, and it was likely it would leave a permanent scar. No mattersuch scars were badges of honor for we. It was this weird drill-caused grooving on my temple that I abhorred; the skin had been torn away and my skull exposed and scored, but somebody had cleaned it and filled it with biogel. It would heal, but it would always *look funny*. ""Saving grace,"" someone said behind me, and I turned to see Flavia looking decent in a battered but repaired uniform. She threw a second repaired uniform and hat onto my bed. "" You can just about cover that head wound with your cap."" ""I'll need a cap if the hair that got torn out by the wind doesn't grow back,"" I responded, touching my metallic red strands gingerly. She was clutching my hand then, and I embraced my sister back. She said in the formal, ""I believed you dead."" I laughed, for I could laugh now. We had survived. "" And I you."" She let me go and looked down at my cast. "" Are you ready to get to work?"" I nodded. "" What's the situation?"" ""Food,"" she said vaguely. "" We have to go out and get some."" ""Somehow I don't think you mean to the store."" The whole military caste. We have to go through those rifts and find food, first for ourselves, and then for everyone else."" ""The farming caste""
She cut me off. "" will do their best, but the Rotation destroyed current fields all over the world."" I gulped. She knew my next question. ""One in seven died in the initial grey wave,"" she said quietly. Closing my eyes, I let my heart feel for Tacitus. He had been our one in seven. She took a deep breath. "" In the Rotation, better survival rates than expected, mainly because the population was already awake primed for danger. Another one in seven."" I clenched my one working hand. "" So""
""Two billion,"" she replied quickly so I didn't have to ask the question. "" In the span of four hours, two billion deaths. Two in seven people dead."" The surge of shock and anger was momentarily overwhelming. "" And the Legates?"" ""Did what they had to do by ordering the Rotation,"" Flavia whispered, her voice heavy with thoughts of our red-haired brother. "" At least that's what people are saying, and that's how we should decide to feel, too, given what such questions might lead to at such a critical time."" Fighting down my pain, I addressed her in the formal as the bond that mattered to me more than allegiance to my caste in this instance. "" Understood, sister."" She took my potentially subversive meaning, but kept her own counsel. "" Let's go down to the Coordination Center and see what we can do. There's a general leave order for those injured, but we can still volunteer."" Gripping her forearm with my good hand, I asked, ""Are you injured?"" She grimaced and turned. Lifting up the back of her top, I found a long bandage that trailed up from above the left edge of her waist to her right shoulder. ""The cut exposed the back of my ribs,"" she said. "" It hurts like no other, but I'm mobile and able, unlike many others."" I hadn't even thought about the wounded. "" ""Four in seven,"" she responded. "" Leaving only one in seven mobile and able for the time being, and many of those are children and young adults whose parents took the hits for them. We need everyone we can get."" I had joined the police academy at sixteen, but we had always been told to expect earlier enlistments if the need ever arose. They would not get a full four years of training like we had, so we would need to lead those sixteen and under when the time came. I mulled this over while we walked under the afternoon sun across wastelands empty of all but oceanic pools and solitary trees. I would not let go of her hand, for every attempt made me think of that moment at the windy well when time had slowed and I had looked death right in its sky blue eyes. The city was bursting with energy. Under the shadow of those towers, we watched as countless cranes worked to pull cars out of the buildings like so many splinters from a finger; the engineering caste had been raised their whole lives for exactly this kind of challenge, and they went about grinning and shouting and welding and operating machines with the kind of glee that could only come from an opportunity for meaningful field work in front of the public after entire careers spent out of sight behind desks. In that manner, our two castes were one, for the population cared little for what we military caste did out of sight and out of mind. The engineers' fervor became my own. ""What can we do?"" I asked the first officer we encountered outside the crowded Coordination Center whose tents and fences had been set up around a dwarfed City Hall that had been protected by the high buildings above it. The officer regarded my doubly-bandaged head and the arm I held in a sling. "" You are very much not required to volunteer."" My glare must have been incredible, for he immediately relented. In the informal, he said, ""Alright, fine. What's your name?"" I gave it, and I asked for the others. ""Septus, Flavia, Porcia, Venita, and Celcus,"" he finally stated, writing something on his clipboard. "" You can go over to""
Jumping, I asked, ""Is Celcus alive?"" He flipped through his papers. "" He should be. He's not on the KIA or MIA lists."" Flavia took the clipboard right out of his dumbfounded hands and eagerly looked for herself. Handing it back, she said to me, ""Let's go."" While we headed through the crowd, a great cheer went up, and we turned to see Legate Blue himself standing atop the steps of City Hall and holding his arms high over the crowd. I stopped and stared, stunned even out of my desire to see Celcus; this was the same man I had seen when I was six and numerous times on big screens after, and he was only made more handsome by the recent peppering of grey in his black hair. He alone among the Legates was not an older white-haired general, and I was not surprised that he had come to us in person. Four soldiers dressed sharply in black and gold stood to his right, and Flavia leapt and pointed. "" It's Caecilia! They survived!"" ---

s_2908_119,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"A couple of things for me personally: cheating; overeating; gambling addiction; mental illness; and same-sex relationships. 1) Cheating. This is a different perspective, and I know a lot of people will downvote me for it or say I'm a horrible person, but I'm talking from the side of the cheater. I cheated on my ex-boyfriend. I was wrong for it. I promised myself I'd never do it again with any other person in the future. I also never did such a thing before. I was in an abusive relationship, mentally and emotionally, and my ex had secluded himself away as a means of punishment. I had moved 1500 miles away from family and friends to be with him. He refused letting me make any friends, and he always checked on me often to make sure I wasn't doing anything with anybody. Then, he told me to move out because it made his life difficult. In order for our relationship to ""make it,"" I had to move into my own place while I worked a temp job that I wasn't sure was going to last long. I did what I had to and moved out into my own place for the first time in my life. I was alone; had no one to turn to as he had me believe my family was an enemy; and I did the only thing I could. I found someone online, talked to them for a long time, and finally decided to meet up. It ended up becoming something sexual. We had sex more than once on multiple occasions. It got to the point where we had feelings for each other and I shut it down. Then, I told my ex. We stayed together another year after that, but I knew it wasn't going to work out and ultimately ended it. But it still messes with me, the way he has me programmed to think I'm unworthy of life without him. Nobody to blame but myself. 2) Overeating often is an eating disorder. It isn't just someone who cannot control themselves. It becomes an addiction, a mental condition and it causes you to make horrible mistakes to the point where your mental and physical self becomes garbage. Can people change? But that doesn't mean it's easy and it doesn't mean everyone can do it the same way as everyone else. I'm tired of these anti-fat people thinking bullying is going to solve the problem. It doesn't. Has it helped some? But I was bullied all my life and I only got fatter. 3) Gambling addiction. It's a different kind of addiction. People look at me strange when I say I have a gambling addiction. They tell me their stories of how they just don't take enough money with them for it to matter or that they know when to stop and leave or if they're up they leave. That's great. I tried it all. I still continue to go until I'm literally broke and spent the rent/bill money, the student loan money, the taxes, other people's money. I have a problem. Thankfully, I'm seeing someone for it and I've been 1 month sober, but it isn't just a simple fix. There's some deep emotional shit in your head that keeps you going back for more to feel like you're worth something. At least, that's how it is for me. 4) I suffer from depression due to low self-esteem as well as a list of other things as you can tell from my response. It's hard when you're trying to get your life together but you have zero energy or you're not sleeping well or you become anxious when talking to strangers in order to get a job/keep a job. It's particularly more difficult when you're trying to find the right dose of drugs to help keep you on an even keel so you can be a regular person without crying every two seconds. I'm now off any drugs and I seem to be doing really well. Been off them for 4 months now. Let's hope I continue doing well. I asked to be on drugs, not prescribed them by a psychiatrist. 5) I'm gay and I've been in many same-sex relationships. Many people in my life seem to make it out that same-sex relationships aren't real relationships or that same-sex relationships aren't the same as heterosexual relationships. My mother often argued that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be in a deep, emotional relationship because we're the same gender. My ex-friend told me that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be married because we didn't have the right to be married and therefore could never understand the deep emotional ties you create when you say 'I do.' Meanwhile, she's now getting a divorce from said husband that she said she was so close to a year and a half ago.",Nobody to blame but myself.,1666,6,1

How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me. These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many ""what ifs"" run through my brain everyday; ""What if I hadn't gotten sick?"" "" What if I'd been more patient"" ""What if I wasn't scared."" We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid. I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you. All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.","All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery.",1989,6,1

So um, follow up, and this part's still being processed kinda. I live in a semi-rural area, and my job involves a lot of driving, and winter and all that bullshit. That's what lead to the event. And I had another job. Less than 24 hours later. ( Late edit for context: it was about another 100 miles of driving.) I called my mom. I told her, I need you to do this for me, but I will be lying down in the back seat, under a blanket the whole time. Because, if I can't get through that, I might never drive again. ( This is part of my depression post - why blame myself for all I need help for?) Mostly got through it. There was a total panic attack near catastrophe, but also another good thought. I was lying down in the back seat of a car. Under a blanket. Not driving. Not seeing. I was not in control, of anything.

He had a habit of saying suicidal thoughts that he would never act upon. I started having those thoughts when I turned 13 they were quiet whispers not so debilitating. I was physically abused by a relative at a party around that time. I don't know when the thought started but they might have been a trigger. I treated them as normal seeing my father always saying those things. I was a very introverted and secretive as a child. My parents never knew what was going on in my mind my friends even less. So I never told my parents about the abuse but it ate me up. I turned 17 failed to to get into medical school I tried to kill myself by overdosing on my father's sleeping pills. A year later I tried again this time it was to escape the debilitating suicidal thoughts, the mood swings, all that pain. I just wanted an escape . My parents and my brother were heartbroken and made me promise to never do it again . After that 10 years of pain ups and downs extreme suicidal thoughts . I spent months planning suicide treating suicide as a backup plan but never doing it just because I was scared to fail again and face my family. I researched percentage of suicide survival. Later on I just wanted to stop existing. It all went downhill last year I could not even get up from my bed. I moved in with my parents spent 2 months lying in my bed not sleeping properly not eating at all. My parents dragged me to see the psychiatrist and he diagnosed me bipolar. I didn't believe him went to second one who said the same thing. I was against the meds I never took them seeing the side effects my father had. My parents forced this time to take meds. I am on them right now after years of constant suicidal thoughts my brain is silent now. I still doubt my diagnosis though. I still feel paranoid that the meds I am taking might make it worse for me later. But joining this sub made me realize there are others out there fighting the same battles I am fighting.

s_1551_0,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Feeling guilty, regretful, and ashamed over what feels like a wasted 5 years I just really need to say something, its eating me up and I have nowhere else to turn. So here it is, 5 years ago soon after I graduated high school I suffered a lower back injury from weight lifting. It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed. I spent months laid up in bed, after finally getting a bone scan after 6 months the doctor told me I was healed and that I needed to do planks to feel better but I didnt care by then. After the next 6 months I tried to distract myself, or find reasons to try to motivate me to rehab that injury but nothing really worked. I tried the planks a little at some point and felt somewhat better, fooled myself into thinking I could handle workout routines I used to do, 0-60 real quick instead of pacing myself and just kept hurting myself every time. Idk why, ego? Damaged pride? Parents never understood every time I tried to say I felt mentally and physically unwell and that I didnt know what to do, and they just kept saying get a job as if that was a cure all. I tried hanging out with friends and drinking, which ended up injuring my knee one night. Eventually friends all went separate ways over the years and Ive felt alone for so long. I was ashamed of not working like everyone else my age but just felt incapable of doing it, I felt more helpless than ever. Parents kept preaching at me about work, I eventually tried a job for a year to just get away from my parents most of the day and to see if that would finally motivate me properly. i was always mentally and physically tired, unmotivated and slowly over time that toxic workplace made me feel like my best was never enough. I quit and told myself I saved up enough money to get me by until I was going to address these injuries and finally move on with my life. During this time the girl I was seeing of 5 months eventually cheated on me. And after 4 months of sulking over her I had sex with a different girl to try and make me forget about her, which led to getting molluscum contagiosum on my genitals but at the time I feared it was something far worse. I was 20 and felt like my life was over before it really got started, I was so scared ashamed and embarrassed. I felt defeated again and again no matter what I did. Gave up, lost hope. But then I mustered up what little courage I had left to go to the doctor, they said they could only do bloodwork and couldnt do physical exams, and that I should go elsewhere to get it looked at. But i wasnt thinking straight, just shaking from the fear and embarrassment. All I could think about was leaving as soon as possible and shutting myself back in my house. I was already there and told her about it, I said just take the blood. I didnt even want to consider more people knowing about it. Results came back a month or so later, everything was negative so it was nothing serious and that relieved me a bit. So I spent weeks on webmd trying to self diagnose myself instead of getting a physical exam like I should have. I just didnt want to be seen at all because I was so ashamed. So I fooled myself into thinking If I wait maybe itll go away in a few months like webmd says and so I waited. A few months pass and its almost my 21st birthday and I was so lonely, no one tried to ever talk to me or see how I was. Felt like my parents gave up on me, almost felt like strangers in the same house, and the rest of my family isnt that close. I stayed inside for almost a year not really doing anything but watching porn, using internet and playing video games. I had no sense of urgency or concept of time, I didnt value or appreciate anything. I didnt care. I couldnt try to reach out to anyone because I felt like there wasnt anyone I could reach to, and Ive never been good about opening up in the first place about personal things. It almost felt like I wasnt real, like nothing was. And everything felt impossible, even the smallest tasks felt like a chore. I hated myself for being so weak and not being strong enough to to the right things. I just couldnt, idk why. I felt like a disappointment and a burden. Sometimes I felt like my suffering wasnt enough to say I was depressed and felt like a loser hiding behind an excuse. I was numb. Time flew by in a blur, after I turned 21 something in me just snapped and I felt, hysterical? I felt like this wasnt right, that it shouldnt be like this. As if something had to be done. A realization that nobody was coming to save me and I had to start thinking and doing for myself. I needed change. I immediately went and got those pesky bumps taken care of, though it took a little longer than it should have. But after that I felt so stupid for being sacred about it all those months prior. I took this realization into 2019, and started trying to finally fix my body. There were set backs, those pains got worse because I sat around for a year doing nothing. And I had stomach pains I never had before that wouldnt go away for over a month, these things discouraged me a bit and that helplessness started to return. My grandmother passed away around this time and it didnt really hurt, so much as it reminded me that life is short and could end at anytime. And that I should try things more and over think less. I went to the doctor again and got checked out, I got a job for a month and got laid off, I tried dating again but ended things early on. These things made me feel alive again, short yet taught me so much compared to previous years. I realized I have so much more of myself to work on and live for. And after delaying it for awhile I set up my wisdom tooth surgery. After the surgery I found that I have courage. And finally around my 22nd birthday I started to workout and rehab my body, and still currently am (unfortunately taking longer than I had hoped). Still feel like I shouldnt work yet until Ive prioritized and ironed out things mentally and physically. Slowly after each little victory my mental health got better. Only in recent months have I started to see and think clearly for the first time in my life, I have genuine confidence. Things that once seemed impossible seem possible. However, like the title says, with this clarity I only am now seeing how I couldve did things differently. How it shouldve been, how if maybe I did 1 or 2 things different maybe things wouldve been better sooner. Maybe Id be further along in life. Im seeing all my old classmates moving on, and here I am stuck in the same place from 5 years ago. Guilt, shame, regret over wasted time. Lost experiences and opportunities in my youth. All I want to do is make up for it, if I can. Im eager and ready, but my body isnt. And the last thing I want is to rush out before it is. And its frustrating. I feel like Im on a time table, and just want to live hard and fast but cant because Im still limited. I wish I wouldve prioritized my body sooner, so I couldve worked more, saved more money and had more options. I dont want to be a failure anymore. I dont know how to quit dwelling on the past, its like Im constantly grieving.

I was already there and told her about it, I said just take the blood. I didnt even want to consider more people knowing about it. Results came back a month or so later, everything was negative so it was nothing serious and that relieved me a bit. So I spent weeks on webmd trying to self diagnose myself instead of getting a physical exam like I should have. I just didnt want to be seen at all because I was so ashamed. So I fooled myself into thinking If I wait maybe itll go away in a few months like webmd says and so I waited. A few months pass and its almost my 21st birthday and I was so lonely, no one tried to ever talk to me or see how I was. Felt like my parents gave up on me, almost felt like strangers in the same house, and the rest of my family isnt that close. I stayed inside for almost a year not really doing anything but watching porn, using internet and playing video games. I had no sense of urgency or concept of time, I didnt value or appreciate anything. I didnt care. I couldnt try to reach out to anyone because I felt like there wasnt anyone I could reach to, and Ive never been good about opening up in the first place about personal things. It almost felt like I wasnt real, like nothing was. And everything felt impossible, even the smallest tasks felt like a chore. I hated myself for being so weak and not being strong enough to to the right things. I just couldnt, idk why. I felt like a disappointment and a burden. Sometimes I felt like my suffering wasnt enough to say I was depressed and felt like a loser hiding behind an excuse. I was numb. Time flew by in a blur, after I turned 21 something in me just snapped and I felt, hysterical? I felt like this wasnt right, that it shouldnt be like this. As if something had to be done. A realization that nobody was coming to save me and I had to start thinking and doing for myself. I needed change. I immediately went and got those pesky bumps taken care of, though it took a little longer than it should have. But after that I felt so stupid for being sacred about it all those months prior. I took this realization into 2019, and started trying to finally fix my body. There were set backs, those pains got worse because I sat around for a year doing nothing. And I had stomach pains I never had before that wouldnt go away for over a month, these things discouraged me a bit and that helplessness started to return. My grandmother passed away around this time and it didnt really hurt, so much as it reminded me that life is short and could end at anytime. And that I should try things more and over think less. I went to the doctor again and got checked out, I got a job for a month and got laid off, I tried dating again but ended things early on. These things made me feel alive again, short yet taught me so much compared to previous years. I realized I have so much more of myself to work on and live for. And after delaying it for awhile I set up my wisdom tooth surgery. After the surgery I found that I have courage. And finally around my 22nd birthday I started to workout and rehab my body, and still currently am (unfortunately taking longer than I had hoped). Still feel like I shouldnt work yet until Ive prioritized and ironed out things mentally and physically. Slowly after each little victory my mental health got better. Only in recent months have I started to see and think clearly for the first time in my life, I have genuine confidence. Things that once seemed impossible seem possible. However, like the title says, with this clarity I only am now seeing how I couldve did things differently. How it shouldve been, how if maybe I did 1 or 2 things different maybe things wouldve been better sooner. Maybe Id be further along in life. Im seeing all my old classmates moving on, and here I am stuck in the same place from 5 years ago. Guilt, shame, regret over wasted time. Lost experiences and opportunities in my youth. All I want to do is make up for it, if I can. Im eager and ready, but my body isnt. And the last thing I want is to rush out before it is. And its frustrating. I feel like Im on a time table, and just want to live hard and fast but cant because Im still limited. I wish I wouldve prioritized my body sooner, so I couldve worked more, saved more money and had more options. I dont want to be a failure anymore. I dont know how to quit dwelling on the past, its like Im constantly grieving. Anyways, if you made it all the way through this thank you for taking the time to read my story","It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed.",278,9,1

So here it is, 5 years ago soon after I graduated high school I suffered a lower back injury from weight lifting. It was the only thing I had that gave me confidence, after a few months I started to feel depressed. I spent months laid up in bed, after finally getting a bone scan after 6 months the doctor told me I was healed and that I needed to do planks to feel better but I didnt care by then. After the next 6 months I tried to distract myself, or find reasons to try to motivate me to rehab that injury but nothing really worked. I tried the planks a little at some point and felt somewhat better, fooled myself into thinking I could handle workout routines I used to do, 0-60 real quick instead of pacing myself and just kept hurting myself every time. Idk why, ego? Damaged pride? Parents never understood every time I tried to say I felt mentally and physically unwell and that I didnt know what to do, and they just kept saying get a job as if that was a cure all. I tried hanging out with friends and drinking, which ended up injuring my knee one night. Eventually friends all went separate ways over the years and Ive felt alone for so long. I was ashamed of not working like everyone else my age but just felt incapable of doing it, I felt more helpless than ever. Parents kept preaching at me about work, I eventually tried a job for a year to just get away from my parents most of the day and to see if that would finally motivate me properly. i was always mentally and physically tired, unmotivated and slowly over time that toxic workplace made me feel like my best was never enough. I quit and told myself I saved up enough money to get me by until I was going to address these injuries and finally move on with my life. During this time the girl I was seeing of 5 months eventually cheated on me. And after 4 months of sulking over her I had sex with a different girl to try and make me forget about her, which led to getting molluscum contagiosum on my genitals but at the time I feared it was something far worse. I was 20 and felt like my life was over before it really got started, I was so scared ashamed and embarrassed. I felt defeated again and again no matter what I did. Gave up, lost hope.

s_568_565,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake ""Hollywood"" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.","I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably.",1619,0,1

s_1514_921,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"So I thought I ate a spider in my sleep... I remembered that half-awake moment of confusion very vividly. I groaned, blinked, and moved my mouth around as I blearily stared up at the dark ceiling. There was some sort of weird hair or something on my lip pulling at it, I felt a subtle slippery tug in my throat, and it took another three seconds to slide the whole thread out. Disgusted and confused, I held it up to the sliver of moonlight coming in the window. What the hell was this thing? Some unknown girl's hair? No - it was wispier than that, more reflective, and a little stickier
I felt suddenly queasy as the thought occurred to me that this was probably a silken spider thread. Had I just eaten a spider in my sleep? Jesus christ! I got up that night, refusing to go back to sleep, but the day's light dispelled my silly fears. If I *had* eaten a spider, it was long dead by now thanks to the stomach acid generously donated by my night-long anxiety. A few weeks passed, and I mostly forgot about the incident. I noticed that, very slowly, I began having trouble exercising at my usual rate. I was sleeping worse, and groggy even when I did sleep. I thought that it might just be the season, or allergies, and I tried to ignore it until I fell asleep at work, and my boss sternly told me to go the doctor. I was never one for the doctor, but I was tired of being tired, so I finally manned up and went. I sat in the stark white office waiting for quite some time. I figured the doctor probably wouldn't have any answers for me - they never seemed to care enough to pursue individual mysteries - but I *was* hoping for a prescription or something. I sat still as the nurse did all the usual tests - blood pressure, pulse, and so on. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She left, and I waited some more. Finally, the doctor walked in, and greeted me without looking. She asked about my symptoms, nodded a bit, and then used a stethoscope to listen to my chest. That's when she frowned. "" It might be allergies, or even asthma. Sounds a bit scratchy in there."" ""That's what I thought,"" I told her. "" I've been wracking my brain. Hell, for awhile, I even thought it was a spider I ate."" She glanced up at me, making eye contact for the first time. "" You ate a spider?"" ""In my sleep, I think."" She hesitated. "" There's this new spider infestation. African, I think. We've had a couple bad reactions to bites. Total longshot here, but if it bit your esophagus or stomach, you wouldn't feel it, but you could still have a reaction. Let's get a soft tissue scan done."" Confused and worried, but hopeful, I followed her advice and went to the next building over in the complex for the scan. The hour queue allowed me to fill out every form and exhaust every magazine in the small waiting room before they finally called me up. I followed the attendant warily into the imaging room. I'd seen it on television, sure, but the experience was far more intense than it looked. I had to lie still for quite some time, fighting all sorts of sudden urges to itch, sneeze, or cough while I waited. By the time it was over, I felt a built-up coughing fit coming on. The smiling attendant came in, told me I did a great job, and started checking things. Alright, I sighed. It was over. Time to get up and get out of here -
Another attendant peeked in the door. A doctor stood behind him. They both motioned for their colleague, and I found myself momentarily alone. I sat up, watching them confer in hushed tones just outside. The three approached me. "" We're going to need you to come with us real quick. It's not an emergency, we just need to speak to you in private."" Feeling hot from my approaching coughing fit, I followed them to a small room, where they directed me to sit and handed me a biohazard waste bin. ""I want you to close your eyes and cough into this trashcan, alright son?"" the doctor told me, his tone quavering. "" And whatever you do, keep your eyes closed. It's important that you don't look, for, um - radiological reasons - from the imaging machine."" ""Yeah, the machine,"" an attendant echoed, gulping. Their masked fear had my pulse racing, but I was more than ready to start coughing to ease the pain in my throat. Leaning over the waste bin, I began a heavy, hacking cough, letting out endless choking breaths that seemed filled with weird dust and particulates. Had I accidentally breathed in something radioactive from the machine? I kept coughing. I tasted a little blood. I breathed in and out. They urged me to keep coughing, their voices shaking and subtly disgusted. ""Come on, just a little more, son,"" the doctor told me. His practiced hands trembled on my shoulder. The last cough seemed to spasm my whole body, and I felt clotted particulates rise up my throat and finally escape. Spitting and pushing more air out through my mouth, I got the last of it out of me. Feeling much better, I made the mistake of relaxing - and opening my eyes. The doctor saw me staring down, and gripped my shoulders tight. "" Don't panic. You're safe now. It's just that - we saw the note about a spider you ate, and we did look at your stomach, but your stomach was fine. It was well, they're attracted to moving air, see and it had made webs, and laid eggs thousands of eggs in your lungs."" In shock, I nodded, unable to do anything but stare at the three-inch-thick pile of baby spiders roiling around in the bottom of the waste bin.","I was sleeping worse, and groggy even when I did sleep.",1103,3,1

s_2527_4,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"I thought it was just my imagination... Okay...This is an update from [what happened to me one night at my parent's house](<URL>). I was pretty sure it was just my imagination after the sun started to come up and I finally drifted off. When I woke later that morning it all seemed like a dream. One thing that I remember is when I got out of bed I noticed an old photograph of me was on the floor. I was standing in my parent's driveway and I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' shirt. I figured it had just fallen off the shelf and put it back. I talked to my parents and husband about the crazy nightmare I had. They agreed it was unnerving, and we all laughed it off. My husband and I returned home and I started to put that night in the back on my mind. However, since it happened, sleep evades me. I lay awake and stare into the darkness for hours, it's only when I see the grey light of day that I feel my eyelids grow heavy. Last night I was having my usual night of insomnia. It was nearly three in the morning. I was sitting in my studio just browsing the internet. I should mention it was a very clear night. All of a sudden the lights flickered and went out. the only light was coming from my computer monitor. I didn't think much of it, because the power went out only a few days ago, due to a bad storm. I still had a full battery on my computer and I decided to shut it down in case the power was off until morning. I walk out as the computer shuts down to get a glass of water and a book. After my computer completely shuts down it's pitch black in my studio, except for the faint moonlight coming from my huge window. The window is curtained and takes up a five by five foot square in the wall. It faces my massive backyard. [ Just took this picture of it about a minute ago](<URL>). I feel relaxed and look at the clear night sky though my window. It's darker inside the house than outside and it's a beautiful view. As I'm gazing up, I notice a tiny movement out of the corner of my eye to the left of my back yard. I glance over an see a figure of a man walking through the yard. At this point I'm a little shocked because our backyard is completely secluded and fenced off for about .5 acres. I decided I would just watch and see what he did since I was confident that he couldn't see me. He started to make his way across my backyard, moving away from my house. I felt relieved. Then he stopped, facing away from me. He just stood there for a good five minutes, about 50 feet from my window. I didn't move a muscle. I just watched and waited. Then he turned completely around. I swear to god, he looked right at me through my window and I could see the whites of his eyes. Through the pitch darkness, I could see them. He started to move towards me. I was completely petrified but still didn't think that he could see me. I backed up to the wall of my studio. He started to move faster. He was only about 20 feet away from my window when the lights came back on. He could see me! He could see me and I couldn't see him! What the fuck?! I ran out of my studio down the hall into the bedroom and grabbed the gun off the night stand. I shook my husband awake and told him there was someone outside in out back yard. I walked to the back door with him, both of us with our guns drawn. I flipped the back light on and slowly opened the back door. We looked around with the flashlight and we couldn't see anyone. My heart was about ready to come out of my chest. We walked out into the yard, with all the lights turned on and with our guns and flashlights, everything started to seem less sinister. I calmed down and we made our way back to the house. As we were walking back, something caught my eye. I looked over and saw a photograph laying in the grass. As I walked over I noticed it was of me. Bemused and feeling a bit giddy from the adrenaline rush, I picked it up. It was a photograph of me standing in my parents driveway as a kid. I was wearing a 'Save the Planet' tee shirt. I flipped the photograph over. Scrawled in red letters, were the words, ""I can still see you.""",Last night I was having my usual night of insomnia.,928,3,1

s_1514_217,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"The Grey Riders [Part Two] My popcorn doesn't have any butter on it, but I prefer it such. Sliding awkwardly between seatbacks and knees, I make my way to our reserved seats at the center of the theater just as the lights go down. I've always loved the cool sanctuary feel of a dark movie theater as I watch both the distant screen from my high seat and an Empire-born movie from my hidden Amber World. Do they know we see what they create? While carefully arranging and depositing sodas, bags, popcorn, a tray of pretzel bites, and a half-eaten bag of red vine knockoffs, I say of the movie we've come to see, ""This is a good one!"" A calm older man to my right smiles. The effect of his sincere cheer is made more pronounced by his slightly crooked nose. "" What's it called?"" ""Die Hard,"" I tell him. Finally situated, I turn my head to my companion on my left. "" You've seen this one, right Tacitus?"" The kind man to my right taps me on the shoulder. I turn back, still excited. "" He tilts his head toward the screen. The moving image seems monstrous in scope, and certainly far larger than I've ever seen such a theatre contain. This particular preview is so full of energy and raw sensory brilliance that it presses upon my very optic and aural nerves. The film being marketed is odd as well; a bruised and battered woman of about twenty with matted metallic red hair is trapped in the clutches of some sort of limbed black sphere. She was hit in the head rather forcefully, and is now briefly unconscious. At that moment, the strange assailant's whirring drill is just beginning to penetrate her skull. What is that?"" The man to my right grimaces in unhappy concern and leans closer to whisper so that the other patrons might not know of our conversation. "" A scout, you could say. Or, perhaps more appropriately, an antibodythe first of many."" As my heart beats to a racing terror in my chest, I tell him, ""I don't think I like this trailer."" My eyes are stuck on the screen, but his gaze bores into my temple with a keening fire. He whispers with rather serious intent: ""It's trying to learn about you. If I were you, I wouldn't let it."" ""She can't get the angle,"" I protest painfully, unable to move for the strict and cramped tightness of my seat. The arms of the chair feel closer every second; the more I struggle, the harder I find myself held. His gaze now feels like shrieking fire against my tilted temple, and I bash backwards repeatedly against my unhappy former sanctuary to no avail. My gunI have a gun! Not popcorn, not a soda, but a weapon clamped to my chest by black limbs. It is pointed up at my coldly merciless assailant, yes, but my head happens to be in the way first. My kind companion turns away with respectful compassion at what he senses I am about to do. I can't get my head out of the way, but I don't need tonot entirely. Opening my mouth as wide as I can in an adrenaline-filled scream, I tilt hard to the right and fire. In that instant, a deafening ringing takes over my hearing. The explosive force rips through my cheek with all the fire I expected, returning me to full consciousness as the restraining limbs fall away. I fought through the sense-blinding pain to crawl and stumble away from the nightmarish thing. By seizing me rather than moving and dodging, it had finally given me a solid shot, and I had taken that shot no matter the cost. It had been practiced skill, not luck, that had helped me avoid destroying my teeth on either side of my planned vector. Holding up my bleeding cheek with one shaking hand and my gun with the other, I turned around and faced it again. That had been my last loaded bullet, and it had finally had an effect. The stunned sphere dragged across the ground in jittery confusion. What important part of it had I hit? I gagged against the overpowering taste of gunpowder and blood in my mouth and nose and throat and ears. My temple burned, but the tender exposed bone there was still intact. My nearly numb fingers ran across warm and wet scored ridges in my skull where the drill had begun its work. Explosions and flashes of light punctuated the distance, but those were too distant to reach my dulled awareness. Caught in the instinctive programming of my training, I let one clip slide out and reached for another. Seated, snapped, clickedI was in control again. Holding my gun out and at the ready, I guarded the zig-zagging sphere as the roar of engines became immediate. Flanked by her three heavily armed comrades, Caecilia removed her helmet, kicked her stand, and remained at a distance with her assault rifle slung forward. "" Venita, are you alright?"" I tried to speak, but the magmatic salt in my mouth forced me to cough instead. I could only nod. ""Is it wounded?"" I nodded again, and spit twice. Finally, by tightly holding my open cheek with one hand, I could manage a decent attempt at speaking. "" Could killed me, but held me, drill into my brain instead."" My tattered dark blue uniform was no longer snappy; despite the wave and the ride, the Dangerous Four in their Special Assault black and trimmed gold looked every bit the savior heroes I'd hoped for, an image reinforced by their daunting semi-automatic weapons. With their helmets now all off, their eyes were intent, and they scattered to surround the malfunctioning sphere at a distance. One of them shouted, ""What do you think its purpose was by drilling into your head?"" Confirming what they suspected, I answered, ""Learning."" Caecilia inched closer to it with a grin. "" Then how about we return the favor?"" After kicking it once and backing away, she stopped its random movement by stepping fully upon it. Her team closed in, and I edged up behind them warily. A chunk of the black exterior was missing thanks to my desperate shot, and we could see strange workings within. Both carefully organized machine parts and pulsing organs worked in tandem inside, and one of its cores was visible. The brunette woman I'd spoken to on my first day all those years ago asked, ""You guys recognize that?"" Caecilia nodded. "" Rainbow crystal. Looks like agravitational Yngtak lattices. That must be how it floats like thatchanges in internal harmonics. But I don't recognize these other technologies."" As we watched, parts of a shattered liver-like organ began cleaving back together rather rapidly. One of the two men realized aloud: ""It's regenerating...""
Caecilia looked sharply back to the rift. "" Venita, it came from there?"" I nodded emphatically despite the pain burning in my every nerve. ""Then we'll send it back where it came from and seal the hole behind it!"" Their confident blonde leader gave a more specific order without words, and the two men of her squad reached down to pick up the damaged sphere. Two glimmering black blades erupted from the device near their hands, nearly slicing them both. The men leapt back, but then nodded at each otherthere had to be a limit to its shapechanging. Carefully gripping the blades with extended fingers, they lifted the double-pointed sphere and ran toward the rift in perfect sync. Not far behind, I followed Caecilia and the other woman right behind, our guns at the ready. As they neared the truck that I had smashed into the hole in the fabric of space, I saw Caecilia leap and roll to her right, and I automatically did the same in the opposite direction. A split second later, a long black blade shot past and impacted into a fallen log. Another long blade sang out with the squeal of changing metal; the man on the left of the sphere threw himself back to the ground to avoid the limb. The man on the right was not quick enough to avoid the third blade, and it stabbed down through his thigh and into the ground. Just as quickly as the blades had sprung out to pierce into the surrounding environs and anchor the sphere, the pinned man swung his gun down and fired a rapid burst into the core of the thing. It whined and died with its mechanical guts hanging outchrome and flesh entrails leaked by a vile black pustule whose sudden barbs had prevented us from removing it from our world. Caecilia peered through the holes it had drilled in the truck on its way in while the other two sawed at the black blade in their comrade's thigh with their combat knives. Still in shock myself, I just stood and watched. I felt like I'd seen something like this in an old Empire science fiction show, and that situation had not ended well for the characters involved. How many shows about doomed worlds had I watched in my youth, entertained by the notion of the end of civilization? Now it was happening to *us*. Backing away from the ruined truck, the normally confident blonde bore a subtly sickened look of intense focus. "" There are more coming."" ""How many?"" the pinned man asked just before gritting his teeth against the pain. She began scanning the shattered road and forest. An instant later, she sprang into action and began pulling at a heavy nearby rock. "" We need to block this. Everything."" Her brunette teammate stopped pulling on the blade in her comrade's leg long enough to ask, ""Ceece, *how many?*"" The blonde just shook her head as she carried her rock over and placed it at the foot of the door to the world with the yellow sky. "" Cram our motorcycles into the holes in this rift, and then hotwire those cars and drive them up on the whole thing!"" They didn't hesitate. After freeing blade from thigh, they ran from vehicle to vehicle, spinning their engines to life in short order. Even their injured member helped carry things, and that snapped me out of my daze. While deep booms radiated through the earth from afar and curling explosions mushroomed into the sky on the horizon, we focused solely on this one point of vulnerability and did our jobs as best we could. It helped me not to panic, but I was completely and utterly exhausted by the time my allies roared in on their own bikes. ""Add 'em to the pile!"" Caecilia shouted to Porcia, Rufus, Septus, and my beloved Flavia, who had now all arrived in their dusty and torn dark blue uniforms wearing expressions of haste and concern. Porcia protested, ""It took us ages to find these""
""It won't matter if those things get through!"" Caecilia pointed to the outsized black burr that had stuck itself into a log, the ground, and a massive displaced boulder. "" They're agravitational, transmorphic, and intelligently adaptive. Don't underestimate them."" Flavia responded for my group. "" Understood."" She nodded to the others, and my four ran their bikes to the pile and threw them on top. This was no time for questions of authority, and, like me, my friends knew when to listen to greater experience and skill. Coming over to me, Flavia touched my wounded temple and cheek and grimaced. "" Porcia, what do you think?"" The more medically-inclined member of our group gave me a weak smile. "" You're not gonna die, but you're not going to look great for your date, either."" Behind her, heavy rock in his arms, my red-haired Rufus asked with surprised wide eyes, ""*Date?*"" While dragging a log, Septus laughed. "" I think I have an inkling of who it might be with!"" To tell the truth, I was crying. They were alive, and they were here, and their presence helped dispel some of the nightmare that had descended around my heart. I told them in the formal tongue, ""Focus your attentions. This is important."" With a happy sob, I informally added, ""I'm glad you're here."" As one, they gave synced serious nods. Flavia spoke for them: ""Of course."" Our pile of machinery, rock, and logs became rather excessive as all nine of us labored to bury the rift in as much debris as we could. It was fortunate, in some small manner, that the grey wave had churned up such destruction; whole unearthed boulders were available for moving, and one was so heavy that it took all nine of us to waddle it up and drop it into place. Crushing the cabin of the truck once and for all, it served as a keystone seal atop our mountain. ""That's enough,"" Caecilia ordered between heaving breaths. Covered in sweat and breathing hard, Porcia protested: ""I can keep going."" Our leader shook her head. "" We can't be exhausted for what's coming. Every scrap of energy will be critical."" We sat under the strange breezes and distant thunders of ongoing battles elsewhere; each of us slowly began breathing at a more normal pace as we recovered our limbs and our lungs. New whinings began somewhere deep in our pilehigh squeals denoting the progress of our enemies as they took to drillingbut Caecilia held a hand up to keep us silent and resting. I knew that it was important we take every second we could to let our energies rise, but I was dismayed that I hadn't thought of the importance of silence as well. I had done it naturally while alone, but this was a more strategic situation; these drilling spheres had no idea what was on the other side, for we had destroyed their scout, and it was to our advantage to take them by surprise. Exchanging words of courage and comfort might have felt like the natural thing to do, but, in this case, it was incorrect. We looked at each other often, wiped sweat from our brows, and slowed our breathing in tacit silence. Given a chance to let my adrenaline pass, I began to shake, and the echoes of gunshots from both horizons set me on edge. Were they faring any better out there? Were their threats easier or worse? It sounded like a dozen drills were at work below us, and I kept re-living the nearly fatal struggle I'd had with just one. Without a word, Caecilia climbed noiselessly down and motioned for us to follow. We nine each found positions behind various vehicles, rocks, or logs. Flavia kneeled with me this time, and her calm touch stilled my shaking gun hand. The second wave was coming, but, this time, I had more than just Tacitus' spirit by my side. It was then, too, that Flavia finally noticed his absence, and she looked to me in askance; I shook my head sadly. She took this wordless news in stride, closed her eyes for a long moment, and then faced our blockade with fire in her eyes. These things hadn't killed Tacitus, but it didn't matter. Either way, they would pay. As before, the drilling stopped without warning. None of us moved. The warm breeze from an explosion to our left blew dust to the side and rustled our hair, but we remained aimed and ready. The kick came, and one of the boulders ruptured in half; we waited unmoving as six black spheres hovered into the killing zone we had established in front of the rift. As a group, they began levitating toward various vehicles and rocks as if examining them. No attention was spared for their inactive brother. Now that I had some idea of which part I was aiming for, I intended to take one down with just a few shots. Studying the tunnel the six spheres had bored through the debris, Caecilia looked to the riftlooked to the sphereslooked to the riftlooked to the spheres and dropped her hand. As synced as the spheres, the nine of us opened fire all at once. I watched carefully for the impact of my shots and downed one with Flavia's help; the Dangerous Four took out one each with their assault rifles, and Porcia, Septus, and Rufus sustained pistol fire on the last until it finally gasped, burped out organs, black smoke, and machine partsand bounced to the asphalt dead. Breaking cover and running to the pile, Caecilia attempted to push a boulder over and re-seal the hole, but a long black blade shot out and nearly skewered her. Retreating, she shouted, ""Fire at will!"" Piercing the exit with the sheer hatred of my gaze for all that had been lost in this strange disasterwhether it was the fault of these orbs or notI gladly joined in filling that tunnel with hot lead. Sphere after sphere ruptured and exploded at its exit; the crescendo of our rifles and pistols was punctuated by whirring machine death cries. Rufus shouted over the gunfire. "" Seal them in with their own corpses!"" Beside him, Septus reloaded with a whoop. Porcia ignored both of them, instead keeping perfect focus on the enemies. It was working. The tunnel became increasingly filled with debris from broken spheres, enough that the rest were having trouble getting through. Flavia reloaded, but waited with a tense expression. ""What is it?"" I asked her. The grey wave had washed away her cap, and, under the orange-blue evening sunlight, her dirty golden hair now glimmered somewhat less for all the caked dust. That marred beauty seemed to match her undermined confidence. "" Do you hear that? They're drillingbut I don't see where."" I realized it, too. We watched in dismay as six new holes were kicked out of the debris and spheres began emerging far more rapidly. Their assault rifles were now doing the bulk of the work, but, by Caecilia's expression, I knew that she knew that we couldn't hold. Leaping up, she shouted, ""Fall back!"" We ran, not as a destroyed rout, but as a solid nine-man unit. In our own kind of gun-bearing phalanx, we kept the approaching tide of spheres at bay, managing to protect ourselves while their greater numbers spread out into the fractured forests. ""How many did you see?"" her brunette teammate asked again, this time demanding an answer. As she led the way over a humongous stretch of upended clay, Caecilia answered with humorless doom, ""Between fourteen- and thirty-thousand."" She
She hadn't told us
because we would have retreated. We would have run earlier. What use was slaying one sphere? Or the hundred-odd we had managed to take down? There were tens of thousands behind those, and she had known the whole time! In that instant, I hated her for her command decision, even though I knew it had been correct. Our blockade had delayed the spheres some number of minutes, and every single second counted. We were nearly out of ammunition now and our survival was likely forfeit, but in trade for our lives we had bought New Rome nearly forty five minutes. Forty five minutes. As the purpling evening sun darkened behind clouds of black spheres spreading out in every direction, I pulled Flavia over the high angle at the top of the wave-deposited clay ridge. "" A sphere hovered close, and she turned and shot it twice; part of its exterior broke off, but she saved her last bullet, not daring to waste it. The sphere put forth a drill and began advancing. From behind, Septus slammed down with a rock and finished the work she had begun. Wild-eyed, and with Porcia and Rufus in tow, he clambered over the ruined machine and after us. Ahead, a roar of resurrection and a blast of light in the death-cloud-cast darkness marked the rebirth of a delivery truck engine; Caecilia ordered us to grab sticks and rocks as weapons and then climb aboard. The front of my uniform was beginning to grow wet from blood leaking from my head and cheek, but I fought off wooziness and kept my heavy branch held ready. Through a small window from the cabin where she and the leg-wounded man sat, our leader shouted, ""Draw their attention any way you can! Keep them approaching our rear!"" Indeed, it was a sort of mobile chokepoint. The flat roof and sides of the delivery truck were not interesting to the spheres, so the bullet or two we used to draw the attention of the portion of the swarm behind us brought them surging at the open slamming doors at the back. Standing shoulder to shoulder, we bashed and crushed over and over again as they approached; some of us crouched down and defended our feet, while others swiped at any orbs that tried to slip in between our heads and the ceiling. Even luckier, the enemy machines bumped and collided with each other as they tried to keep up with our high speed and debris-dodging swerving. Would this actually *work?* The black-and-gold suited brunette called up, ""They're not using swarm dynamics!"" The man in the passenger seat of the cabin repeated her words, and Caecilia called back, ""Are you certain?"" What had she meant by that? Watching my enemies as they pushed forward, I realized that there was something ungainly and ungraceful about these monstrous machines. They didn't flow together like birds did in the sky; they didn't coordinate easily and automatically by following the unit ahead of them. In fact, the more there were, the less effective any single orb seemed to be. That mirrored something I instinctively recognized. "" They're not independent!"" I shouted, gripping my cheek and nearly passing out from the pain as I did so. The brunette affirmed my realization. "" Something is controlling them from afarsomething on the other side of that rift, no doubt."" Caecilia didn't have time to continue our analysis; she and the man up front had been forced to start expending the last of their assault rifle ammunition as the swarm became an eerily silent cloud of dark blots around us. And, step by step, we were being forced deeper into the truck. Drills began shooting sparks from the sides and ceiling, and a blade or two stabbed through at length. I fell due to a bump in the road and avoided the first, but a followup slashed my left sleeve, and a third skewered Rufus through the lower abdomen. Porcia screamed with anger and broke the blade off with her heavy rock; our red-haired teammate grimaced and retreated behind us, his back now up against the little window to the cabin where staccato gunshots echoed rapidly. After taking a shoulder stab herself, Flavia followed to help defend him against incidental attack. That was the real enemy. I was tired. I had been exhausted before this had even begun, and now I was bone-weary. I was moving ineffectually and reacting slowly, and I knew it was only a matter of time until I fell. The black-and-gold suited man to my right pushed me back. "" You're done! ""But""
He shoved me hard, and I fell next to Rufus and Flavia, who held me down and insisted I listen. Septus and Porcia tried valiantly to help in the defense, but numerous little slices along their arms and legs began adding up, and a drill coming up from the floor pierced Porcia's foot, ending her run. At the last, it came down to Septus alone guarding us four casualties in the very back; we watched in amazement as, beyond him, the two standing members of the Dangerous Four used the new spacenow that we were out of the wayto engage in a graceful tandem dance of destruction. The man took to swinging his metal rod this way and that, rupturing sphere after sphere; his brunette teammate dodged around him, drawing attention from the orbs breaking in through holes in the walls and ceiling while crushing any that got through with her heavy rock. All this they pulled off while the truck swerved dramatically left and right to avoid unseen obstacles at high speed; all this they did with fury in their eyes. These truly were the best of the best, and I understood now why they were so highly regarded. But there were just too many. The only light now was a small rectangular beam leaking in through the cabin window from the reflected headlights; I steeled myself and prepared to join Tacitus. Without so much as a horn of retreat, the cloud of spheres suddenly pulled up and away. Opening my eyes, I found myself on the back of an open and flat truck bedthe rear had been entirely ripped apart and cast aside piece by piece. The two elites stood steaming like fire elementals, breathing hard and casting their expert eyes about in search of further enemies. They were exhausted like us, I knew, but they had some sort of inhuman second level of endurance in which they burned their very life force to keep alert and fighting. Walls suddenly shot past, and I realized where the orbs had gone. We had reached the city limits, and they were surging up in thick black rivers to get a better vantage point. Like vast horrible fingers they were, or arms spreading out to grip New Rome, and I could almost see the intelligence behind them at work in that reaching grasp. I looked at my watch: only seventy two minutes had elapsed since the warning call had gone out. We could not count on the military to be present and ready. The streets and buildings here formed canyons whose piled industrial debris completely blocked the way by truck. As we came to a stop, I stared to my left and right at the dark maws of broken windows and shattered doors. The contents within were not entirely ruined, for the flood had been dry, rarer than water, and had come and gone quickly; the damage seemed more akin to an earthquake and a hurricane than an apocalypse. No, the end of the world would be from these spheres, not the strange flood and wave. We slowly climbed down from the ruined truck and took our first steps on the shattered glass and loose rubble of New Rome's surviving remains. After finishing relaying everything we had learned over the radio, Caecilia looked up at the circling black swarms and then turned to us. "" Most of the other rifts have been successfully defended, but guns aren't going to solve this one. The higher-ups have a plan, a last ditch effort, and I think it will workat a great cost. We were too weak to talk, so Septus responded for us: ""Go?"" ""Go find your loved ones,"" the leader of the Dangerous Four told us. "" If you can. Time is short."" She moved and motioned, and her three teammates began climbing over the downed building blocking the road. "" Be safe, fellow officers. Survive this."" When they were over the top and out of earshot, Porcia said bitterly, ""We've been left behind because we would have held them back."" Rufus lowered his head; Septus grunted; Flavia just helped me stand, and together we began staggering in a direction we knew well. ""Where are you going?"" Porcia called. "" You aren't leaving us behind too, are you?"" As she held me up, Flavia looked me in the eyes, glanced down at my open cheek, and then turned back to yell, ""We're going to see our grandfather."" I shook with pain and utter exhaustion, but I still managed to smile at that. My grandfather had often insisted my sister in arms was part of our family, but she had always politely refused out of respect for memory of her mother and grandmother. But she had not added the part that resounded in my thoughts a heartbeat later: *if he still lives.* Rufus and Septus studied the mood of the clouds of black dots high in the sky. "" How do you evaluate it?"" the red-haired said to his ally in the formal tongue. The youngest son of his family responded, ""We are duty bound to protect them."" Informally, he added: ""My older brothers are assholes anyway. Together, they lifted the sobbing Porcia between their shoulders and helped her avoid using her pierced foot. Happy that we were sticking together, I limped along beside Flavia until they caught up, and we weak and wounded five picked our way through alleys and over hills of rubble while staying out of sight of the ominous watchers above as best we could. By my watch, eighty five minutes had passed. If the spheres just took a little bit longer to evaluate the complex battlefield below them, there was a chance we could run out the clock, for they did not know there was a clock at all. We had no such fortune. As we neared Collis Oppidum, the ancient slum district in which I lived, I regarded the upward slope of the familiar long hill that usually meant I was nearly home, while, at the same time, I saw individual black dots descending from on high. Despite the difficulty and pain of talking, I said, ""They're doing it again."" Flavia asked, ""What is their strategy?"" ""Those are scouts,"" I told my worried teammates as we stopped and leaned in a huddle to keep from falling over. "" Just like before, they're sending individual spheres to analyze areas. With more focus, that single one is far more dangerous."" Heads nodded around me in the huddle. Septus asked, ""What do we have?"" Flavia responded, ""I've got one bullet. Anyone else?"" Nobody else. Rufus reached down and pulled at a jutting piece of rebar at our feet; failing that, he broke it off with a heavy rock. "" Everybody get a metal rod. It's quicker than a rock and more effective than a branch."" Wearily, we followed suit, breaking weapons out of the shattered foundation of the building on which we stood. Porcia suggested, ""Let's stick to alleys and out of sight."" As one, we five breathed in, stepped carefully down high narrow alleys, and kept our eyes sharp. We were only four blocks away from the quarter of Collis Oppidum that held my home, but every heartbeat felt fraught with dangerand it was. As we approached a junction between four close ramshackle buildings, a long bladed spear shot out and sliced Flavia's midriff as she dodged back; four rods slammed down and broke that spike before following it back to its source and beating it to pieces. There was no more protection by stealth. We ran; even Porcia on her leaking foot. On each street and in each alley we encountered a sphere that had learned from each of its predecessors. The second tried to stay out of reach and stab at us from afar, but Septus ran up a debris slope, leapt, and slammed it down into our waiting mob. The third, lying in wait, had actually donned a sort of armor for itself by incorporating rubble into its makeup; with this one, we did rod-to-blade battle for three long and exhausting minutes that we could not afford. Septus took a stab to the thigh, and Porcia a rotating hammer-like appendage to the ribs, but I decided to mimic our opponent and adapt by using my rod as a spear instead of a club. Stabbing down with all my might, I penetrated just between pieces of rubble armor, and the sphere smoked and died with a fading scream. One more block. One more sphere. We found it waiting for us high up between two fire escapes; like an army not daring to leave a hostile castle behind them, it knew we would not just walk underneath it and let ourselves become surrounded if other spheres were ahead. It was practically inviting us to climb those fire escapes and do battle from either side at heights where its agravitational movement gave it an advantage. My cheek was numb from adrenaline and constant pain now, and I spoke freely: ""It's here."" Breathing hard beside me, her face covered in traces of blood and dirt and her blonde hair dark brown and grey from rubble-dust, Flavia asked in the formal tongue, ""Our enemy?"" I nodded. Whatever force it was that operated these spheres had turned its full attention on us, and I understood why: I had been the first contact, the first to fight back, and an ongoing resister. Even without drilling directly into our brains, it was *learning about us*, and it was entirely possible we had been permitted to survive this far so that the experiment could continue. It would have been a simple matter to smash a thousand spheres bodily down upon us like a hammer if the intelligence observing us had been so inclined. An antibody... this was how the immune system worked. Encounter a hostile organism, develop a defense, and then deploy it en masse. We were on that second step, and letting the enemy complete its research would bring down untold horrors upon us when the third step began. I put my hand out to my teammates to tell them what I had realized, but Flavia raised hers first. The sphere fell, broken, as her final bullet felled it. I turned and looked back at the city, now lit solely by a sliver of liquid orange sun peeking over the horizon, and now spread out before us because of our position on the high hill at its outskirts. The swarms above swirled faster, casting long animated shadows across the landand they began to descend like a horrible dome of night come early. The intelligence had learned enough from its various scouts throughout the city, and now it was going to cleanse us. ""* For the first time in my life, I did more than flirt with that second level of endurance whose mastery I had seen in my elite comrades. Death was upon us like a shadow out of the evening sun, and I wanted to see my grandfather one last time. I wanted him to know Flavia had accepted us. I wanted to drink tea. I wanted to curl up by his knees and hide against the coming darkness like I had as a child. His stories had always been inspiring, engaging, and even frightening, but they had never left me despairednot like this. With the frenzy of life nearing its end, I ran past the communal well and began tearing away the piles of wood that had buried the front door of my apartment. The slums were mostly made of wood rather than stone, and, paradoxically, that had left them far less damaged by their own partial collapse. High on the hill of Collis Oppidum, these buildings had taken a fraction of the grey wave's impact. Was it possible that my grandfather had survived? My four brothers and sisters pulled at the debris with fire to match my own, but because of the descending cloud of death above us. Crawling in the small hole we finally managed to open, I slipped into the first room of my two-room apartment, pulled my flashlight off of my belt, and marveled that everything was still in its place and tidy. Running to the back room with a hopeful grin, I came up short, and my excitement faded. My grandfather lay unmoving on the floor with his eyes closed. My flashlight illuminated piled wood on the other side of our apartment's sole window. He'd been buried here all alone, with no way out and no place to find breath. I dropped to my knees as my friends surged in behind me and then fell silent. ---

s_337_0,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"When I was younger suicide was honestly always a thought in the back of my mind. I thought it was normal because nobody really talked about it. IT literally never even crossed my mind that that was a big deal. I only acted on it a couple of times by self harming and taking some pills, but I always stopped myself before it went too far. My mom struggled with depression her whole life as well, but she always told me that she never had suicidal thoughts in her entire life. It was a weird realization that suicidal thoughts weren't a part of other people's everyday bad moods like they were for mine. I don't know that I'll ever act on them because I do still have hope for my future, but when I think about my past those suicidal thoughts are worse. Anyway, you're definitely not alone, but it also isn't normal to feel that way. You should reach out and try to get help. Talk it out with a professional--your friends probably want to help, and you should recognize that, but don't let them be your only resource for help because being a teenager in general is a shitshow, regardless of whether suicidal thoughts are present, and they probably won't have anything super helpful to say. Don't be ashamed that this is the way you are, but my personal opinion is that it's not something you should be blase about. Suicidal thoughts are things that you should express to people you trust and feel you can confide in, but when it comes down to it you are the only person who can deal with them. Other people can support you, but it's up to you to make a difference for yourself. I wish you luck, and if you want to talk about what you're experiencing please feel free to reach out. Also /r/depression is a great place to vent to other people who are living with these feelings, like you.","I don't know that I'll ever act on them because I do still have hope for my future, but when I think about my past those suicidal thoughts are worse.",602,8,1

Spoiler: gt;!This is a tragic update! lt; Trigger Warning: gt;!Suicide! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/ThrowRAihatemymom](<URL>) **Mom(40F) cheated on Step-Dad(45M) and ruined my(16M) and my siblings' lives** I am a 16 years old male. I have 2 sisters (10F,8F). Our biological father was never in our lives. He left my mom when she was pregnant with me, came back 6 years later and said he wanted to make amends and that we could be a happy family. Somehow my mom immediately started saying that she loved him but he left after mom got pregnant again. Then 2 years later he came back, I cried and begged my mom to not let him into our lives because I hated him. Well, he said the same thing, my mom also said she loved him and then he left after she got pregnant again. My mom was a waitress so the 4 of us lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I was essentially another parent to my sisters because mom was always working. Sometimes, we wouldn't eat breakfast or dinner because we couldn't afford it. Other times, I did not eat anything so that my sisters could eat. My mom met another man (45M) a year after my youngest sister was born. He is a really good man. His wife and daughter had died in an accident a long time ago when he was in his 20s. He met my mom when he was ready to date again. He is a really good man and treated us like his own children and I consider him my father. He was very wealthy and owned multiple businesses. We eventually moved into his huge mansion like house. I also had a better school there. We 3 siblings got our own rooms and I got better clothes, played video games for the first time in my life and a bunch of other things. He taught me things, helped me catch up in school because I could not do well in the previous school. He spent a lot of time with the 3 of us. My sisters eventually started calling him ""dad"". I followed shortly after. I remember him crying, hugging us and telling he loved us when we called him dad for the first time. They eventually got married and dad asked me to be one of his groomsmen and of course, I said yes while my sister were my mom's bridesmaids. Mom stayed at home to take care of us. As far as I know, they were very happy together. They went on dates at least once in 2 weeks, kissed each other frequently and always told each other that they loved each other. He also knew about mom's past and realized she had issues and got her into counselling. I was really happy that my mom had finally found someone who treated her well. I was also very happy for myself and my siblings and really loved him. He also said that he would pay for college for the 3 of us. My dream is to become a doctor and I never thought it would be possible cause it was so expensive so and I was so freaking happy. Mom also told me she was very lucky to have found him and that she loves him and is very grateful of how he has made her and our lives better. Well, last year July dad discovered that my mom was having an affair with his best friend who was also the best man at their wedding. Apparently, the affair was going on for a long time, I do not know exactly how long. Mom cried and begged him to give her another chance. He didn't, understandably. He let us keep all the new things such as clothes for me and toys for my sisters. When I went to him crying and asking him why he was leaving us he just hugged me and told me about mom's affair. He said the affair is too painful and that he cannot be in this marriage anymore and then said that he loved me and my sisters. My sisters do not know about the affair, I do not think they will understand. He got a prenup so mom did not get anything that wasn't hers. Dad just had to pay the rent of a new apartment until the divorce was finalized. We stayed in a decent apartment but after the divorce was done we moved into a much smaller apartment. I tried to be in contact with him but it does not seem like he wants a relationship with me. He has never responded to my messages. I sent a final letter to him last year December thanking him for everything he did for me and my sisters and that I loved him and would remember him forever. So now we're back to a one bedroom apartment, skipping meals and barely being able to afford anything. I sleep on the floor now. My sisters share a bed while my mom uses another. Mom is a waitress again. I've also taken a part time at a grocery store to help with money. I just hate my mom so much right now. I only took the job to help my sisters. I have also stopped talking to mom. Recently she came crying to me and told me that she was sorry for ruining everything and she wanted me to talk to her. I broke down and just said ""I don't understand. Why did you cheat on him? He was taking such good care of you and the 3 of us. He was also gonna send us to college. For the first time in my life, I was happy. You have destroyed my life. Why do you always have to ruin everything? You already did that twice when you let \[bio father\] back in my life. I hate you. I never want to talk to you again"" She was crying a lot after I said that. I am gonna admit, what I said was pretty rude but at that time I was just so angry. I just hate her so much right now. I just wish she dies a very painful death. These thoughts are the only things in my head. It's making me go insane and I know it's not normal. I read online that therapy would be useful but we can't even afford food on most days so we don't have insurance. All I can think about is how she ruined everything. He didn't even ask for much. Mom was living such a luxurious life and was just at home taking care of her own biological children. I just miss him so much. Even my sisters keep asking when they are going back home or when they'll see dad again. They've also started crying and asking for dad a lot of times this past year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so frustrated and just angry at everything. I wish I could run from here but if I did who would take care of my siblings. That stupid mother can't do shit. I guess I'm here cause I need some help. I don't really know what to do. Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything. Other days I just wished I died and all of this ended. [UPDATE](<URL>) **My Mom(40F) Committed Suicide Because Of Me(16M)** Hello everybody. This is a throwaway account. About 2 weeks ago, I found my mom dead in our house. She had sent my siblings (10F,9F) to their friend's house and then hung herself. She really changed after she got divorced from my step dad after she cheated on him (I made a post about it recently). My mom and I didn't talk a lot after that. One of the last things I told her was that I hated her and asked her why she ruined my and my sisters' lives. I wish I didn't say that. Maybe she would have been alive if I supported her. I have had no contact with my step dad after the divorce. My sisters and I live with my mom's sister and her husband now. We never met them before this and even my mom never had contact with them but they are the only family that could be found and they agreed to let us live with them. My siblings and I don't like living here. Both of them are constantly shouting at each other and at us. We're just so uncomfortable here. I don't think they can afford food for all of us. I have a job at a grocery store so I mostly buy food for my siblings. My boss is also very nice and allows me to take home some extra things for free. I really miss my mom. My sisters are also always crying for her. She had her flaws but I still love her. She's my mom. The last thing I told her was that I hated her. I just wish that I told her that I love her and supported and helped her. Then she would've been alive today. What I told her tipped her over the edge. I can't do any of this anymore.

My depression is not the cause of my pain. As a matter of fact it is the other way around. Actually, I have never been as insane as I have been since my pain started getting bad. I am so tired of being tossed around from specialist to specialist like a damn potato. It's like every one of them is going ""Not it! You touched it last!"". I am beyond ready for one of those fucks to just give me a damn prescription for tramadol already. But like you were saying, it just doesn't work that way. I feel like they won't even take me seriously despite the fact that I had to derail my whole life because of my pain. At this point I'm not even expecting to get fixed enough to go back to work. It would be nice to be able to go to the store or even take a shower though. I know tramadol is still addictive and blah blah withdrawal and so on. But I would much rather have a physical drug dependency and a life than constant intolerable pain and no life. Also, it doesn't even get me high! Which is totally cool. Did I mention that I'm 23? So there goes my life and apparently I will have to wait 20 years for a doctor to be willing to give me narcotics to actually manage my pain. If the non narcotics worked I wouldn't still be asking for pain relief. I would rather have my job back and not deal with drugs or pain but that's not an option. All I get is pain and no management.

So I want to make this clear. I am a good guy and if you don't believe me, read everything below. The only 2 things I do with my long distance girlfriend is playing videogames and chatting about NON-sexual topics. I do NOT have any sexual desires with my girlfriend. The only reason I ""date"" her online is because I love playing videogames and chatting with her. We are not really dating anyway, we are basically ""best friends"" but the small difference is that we agreed on an official relationship. That doesn't mean much, it **doesn't mean there is alot of romance or anything sexual**. She lives her own life and I'm not too involved with her anyways. And no, **I do not want her to move to my country**. I did first but I realized it was a mistake. She is too young for such decision so I really don't want her to do that. About the 5 years age gap, you can have your opinion that it is too big, but I simply disagree and you really don't have to hate me for not sharing your opinion. If I am a 40 year old man dating a 10 year old child, that would be a big issue, but cmon 21 and 16 is not an extreme difference **especially because I do nothing sexual or weird with her.** You may think it's a too big gap, but since that is your opinion and it also isn't an extremely big gap, you should really not show so much hate to me.

I moved away from my family in February, and the time I'm spending away will come to an end some time in May 2016. I do not want to move back with my parents at all. My plan was to move to a city about 9 hours away with my dog, and to go to school there (in Canada). I am lucky enough to have parents who are saving up money for my education (unless they're lying to me about that ..), so I will be using this money for school, then try to get a job. The city I'll be moving to is really cheap, and is right by the border, which separates it from a major American city, so there is opportunity from two lands there. I think I've matured enough in the last few years to understand that this isn't going to be easy. And I've accepted potential defeat, though I'm still a stubborn kid at heart, and I refuse to fully accept the outcome of potential failure (like moving back with my family). Doesn't mean I wouldn't. Stories like this scare the shit out of me. I like to believe that I'm ready to live alone, and in a sense, I am! I am partially doing it right now. But money wise, I am terrified. I don't want to have debts, I don't want to be worried about where I spend my money. I know how to budget and I can live cheaply (though sometimes I go overboard), but who says I'll be getting a job? Who says I'll be able to live cheaply at all? For instance, I don't need much space so a studio apartment is perfect for me. I found one for less than 400 dollars a month, which is amazing. Everything included. However, a roof over my head is not the only thing I'll be needing to pay for. Of course, bringing a pet into the mix basically means paying hundreds of dollars for it per year. Will I be able to afford it? Also, food. Food is not so cheap in Canada compared to the US. And, transportation. The city I selected doesn't have a good transportation system, meaning I'll have to figure something out. I'm not a fan, plus it's expensive. Summers are hot in that city, and Canadian winters are not really forgiving to bicycles. And ... who says I'll be getting the hours I need from a job? Who says I'll ever get a job at all ...

This is my ""self"" interpretation of my perceptual glasses looking at this game.) Now I'd like to add in my ""self"" perspective on all this. I don't want to play the game at all. I want know part in it. I don't want to be happy or anything else. I enjoy the toys I have but at the end of the day I recognize that there is no end game and that leaves me unfulfilled. Am I depressed? Yes, but also not exactly. If anything it gravitates toward nihilism. All of my hobbies and interests go unfulfilled and eventually they no longer make me happy because I realize how very boring it all actually is. The only thing that makes me happy is making other living things happy, people obviously included. More than that; As a mere mortal ape I would love the opportunity to become no one in the next life. This isn't for me and I'm tired of playing this ridiculous game that goes on forever. I'm not necessarily suicidal, but at the same time I am. Really hard to explain to someone that you don't want to live but you don't want to die. From a young age I've had a fascination with miniatures from city building games to toys and everything in between. I was never very good at them though, because I never knew what the ""right"" move was because I've always felt that the ""right"" move is totally based on your point of view. I'd have more fun clicking play and watching it grow on it's own. To see all the little deviations it creates and all the wonders and disasters that come with every little variation with no influence from me because I simply can't make a decision on the ""right"" move. They're all the right move depending on your perception. This is the same reason I've always been a bad speaker and came off as shy or awkward in conversation (I know, now I'm getting personal but I'd like to get this off my chest.) Someone could say something to me and I just go blank, I don't know what to say next. It's really hard to explain but I think you grasp the idea. I could never decide on anything. Which pet, which spouse, which family member (Family is not immune to this.), which of anything because they could all be the right decision.

s_201_11,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Had a very bad breakdown/anxiety attack in school today. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have nothing going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...
I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...

s_117_857,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"That is a really tough issue. In my current relationship everything works out because I'm not totally opposed to sex, and we're also poly so my partner is free to have sex with someone else if he wants. But we aren't married and don't have any kids, so I can't give you any perspective there. What I can tell you is that you shouldn't feel horrible or that you're a freak. You can't help wanting to have sex with your wife - you're a sexual person, and I'm sure you love her very much. However, speaking from an asexual perspective, I probably understand your wife's situation better than I do yours. I sometimes feel guilty about the fact that my SO and I aren't entirely sexually compatible. I know that he wants to please me and share physical contact with me; that is a core part of a relationship for most people. Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex. And then I feel bad because he feels bad, even though it's neither of our faults. I think that's a key point here - this isn't anyone's fault. You can't help having desires, and she can't help not having them. Both of you are perfectly normal in this. But it is causing friction in your marriage, so it does have to be dealt with. If you've been married long enough that you have more than one child I assume you've probably been through a lot together, and you love each other and want to make each other happy. Start from there. Have a conversation about this with your wife. Remember that no one is the guilty party here, and have a frank discussion about your feelings. Be honest with each other. Once you figure out what each person wants and needs, you can work together to form a strategy to fix the issues you're having. This doesn't have to be a huge issue in your relationship, but it will only get worse if you don't communicate about it.","Whenever we are intimate, I can tell that he wishes he could do more for me, but I'm just not that into sex.",819,1,1

But it's also frustrating to get through my own first month and only have lost 10 pounds. I've basically plateaued since after the first week. I've had a couple of cheat meals (one being yesterday), and it seems like it takes my weight forever to get back on track even though I'm pissing dark pink on the sticks and have smelly breath. I posted a comment not too long ago about waiting to exercise until I'm down some more weight, but I decided with my current frustration to change my mind. I'm starting some light weight training tonight with my husband. I'm giving up most of the artificially sweetened things that were staples of my beginning keto diet. I have to remind myself that my progress will probably be slower than others', since in the past 18 months I've lost 50 pounds and gained 30 back. I know yo-yo dieting has an effect on speed of weight loss, as well as my PCOS (and, therefore, insulin resistance), hypothyroidism, and IBS. One thing I will say for certain that I'm very pleased with: my sugar addiction is gone. It was so bad before I got married and started keto that about twice a month I would have this enormous craving for cookies or cake and go to Wal-Mart to fulfill my desires. For those of you with insulin resistance and former sugar addiction, you know this craving was basically insatiable. You'd go, eat half the carton of oreos (or even the whole carton if it was a particularly bad one) and then feel like death was coming afterwards. Now, I have that deathy feeling even after a small cheat. I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me. It's horrendous. This morning, for example, I feel like death and an overly inflated balloon. I had one of my sister's famous brownies yesterday and I felt like hell the rest of the day. So even though I'm frustrated at my lack of success, thank you, /r/keto, for curing my addiction.","I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me.",1676,5,1
s_993_1080,Find evidence for cognitive issues in this post,I am sorry to say this but only you can make this decision. It's a tough decision no doubt. I was in banking industry and had lots of mental breakdown etc. I took a break thought that job was the problem ...maybe it is...tried looking for other job where my illness won't affect me much.. couldn't find one So now I am back in banking with more responsibility than before. I had 6 months for the switch as I was in another job. Each day I dreaded if I am making the right choice. Will I suffer breakdowns. Is it worth it to go back to square one. But I was not getting younger so this was it. I have taken the job and I am kinda doing okay for now. I don't know about the future. So TL:DR You might always have this fear of having mental breakdowns...it's natural after going through it... We always have to choose between advancing in career and mental stability...bitter truth...atleast I had to. It's just how much you could sacrifice. Your mental health is foremost. It should not be to the point of mental breakdowns. So know your triggers foremost...like you said it was pandemic and a bad breakup before. Just go back and analyze yourself. Talk to friends and family as they would have much clearer picture. Try to have a plan to handle those triggers. Based on your post I feel you should go for it. I feel it's kinda important to you professionally. Taking risks is a part of life. Just before going in evaluate everything...get in touch with alumni and difficulties they faced...if you can defer it a bit then do so...as you can self evaluate more...try working a bit and then go for it...maybe a year or two you have done the bachelor's so half the battle is done. Also you are now diagnosed so keep a lookout for warning signs. It would help if you don't go spiralling down and get help beforehand.

I have old injuries that need to be corrected, but for years I always put it off because I had zero motivation and gave up. On top of relationship, family, and other health concerns. This past year Ive been slowing gaining momentum and Im feeling a lot better. But now I feel like Im hitting a wall, it becomes so frustrating I feel like I get burnt out, and then end up feeling like I need to force myself into doing something however I just end up thinking about it all day and maybe do it last minute if that, and if I dont do it i really beat myself up over it the next day and it becomes harder. I know doing these things is for the best, and it seems to be the only hurdle in my way to move forward and be happy, but when I hit that wall my mind shuts off and things seem kinda hopeless all over again. The loneliness and zero support probably doesnt help. I find myself praying to god to heal my body every night. And every day when the frustration gets to be to much I just scream and question why this had to happen to me. If these injuries never happened Id probably have had a happier and better last 5 years.

We've always been friends. Even when he moved across the country two years ago to be with his girlfriend, we still caught up and saw each other when we could. That girlfriend broke up with him, so he called me tonight to vent and just bounce ideas. But he just reminded me that I'm not alone, that we're very similar people and that we care about each other and are great friends. In a moment where I felt very alone, he unknowingly reminded me that I am not alone at all. Pick up the phone.

s_481_30,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"[17/m] I'm in a triangle with two friends and it's driving me insane, would love some advice :) So I've been friends with this girl I really like, and long story short, I really think I love her. I know it sounds stupid af, but just hear me out. I've never even tried to be in love because I'm so scared of a broken heart. Then she came along, and we became friends. We hang out a lot after school and text. We even have the gold heart thing on Snapchat. It sounds cringy, I know, just hang in there :D
On Snapchat, she sends me pictures where she clearly poses and takes the time to make them look good. Some of my friends actually thinks we're dating, but we're not. I say some because I think she likes another guy, and he happens to be my close friend. While she acts like she likes me (she must just be really polite idk), she's more physical with him (he sits in her lap and sleeps on her shoulder). I've also seen her drawings of him playing the piano (she's a really good artist). He's a really good guy, and if there is a thing between those two, I would hate to be a jerk to either of them and get in the way. We're both (the other guy and me) really good at the piano and we both play video games. I guess I have more in common with her than he does cuz we (the girl and me) love to write and watch anime (the other guy doesn't do either). All three of us are pretty weird though even though we're all well liked as people at school. The problem is that I actually really like her. I've never felt this way with anyone and I sometimes feel like I'm accidentally gonna blurt out ""I love you."" This whole unofficial love triangle has been going on for months now, and it's driving me insane. The one time I actually feel emotionally invested in someone, I know it's just a dead end because I have a long history of losing. The other part of me wants to desperately win because I don't think I'll ever find someone quite as unique as her. I might get close and I might find other unique people, but she's special. Bottom line, I think I'm being led on, and she's going to eventually fall in love with him. I'm just so freaking terrified by this because I know it's going to break my heart. And isn't that why I never tried to get close with a girl before? I have planned my final attempt. If this doesn't win her heart, then I'm dropping it, and I'll deal with the sadness. I wrote her a song that's not specifically addressed to her, but she'll realize at the end who I'm referring to. I already booked a slot in the upcoming Valentine's Day assembly at school so I'm pretty set on doing this. Other than that, do you think that I should just drop it? If so, if you could give me some coping mechanisms to deal with the pain, that would be awesome. Thanks, and you're the best :)

s_1499_253,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Haha, so, the funny thing is, mine is that and also backwards but I've been wanting to vent so here goes. I was a very hyperactive child. Not the run around in circles and fight people kind, the cantstopfidgetingohmygod kind. My mom worked in education and decided to have me observed by the school. They tell her it's because I have ADHD. So she takes me to therapy but tries to weasel her way into every appt. The therapist realizes this and starts asking me ""you're big enough to have this appointment alone, right?"" And I would always nod and my mom would always do and say awful things to try to get me to fess up as to what I had told the doc. I think she was taking me for appearances, and to tell the therapist that I was just acting up for her, as she did and does often. She kind of realized that taking me might backfire because the therapist wasn't an idiot. Guess who magically got better and didn't have to go to therapy anymore? And then when I was still hyped out of my mind and couldn't write a single sentence without wanting to die, she would say I was just being lazy/whiny and being bad. She would say that I did it at home too, but only when I had to actually focus and do things but that she was sure I was faking it. The other teachers at my school, where she worked, believed her. Son of a bitch. Later, when I was 11 and already showing signs of depression, she would scream at me for crying or for not being cheerful about some bullshit that I hated or for not immediately praising her for things. When I really started to retreat into my room more, she would yell that I deserved to be there anyway and I could stay there until I grew up and got a better attitude. I was self harming by 13 and miserable and she didn't give a shit. I was in an awful place by the time I was 13, but I kept up appearances alll the way until Junior year. I was in clubs, on teams, I was doing just okay in classes. Then I crashed. I failed all of my classes and they made me go to a special school where I could make it up. I knocked two years of classes out in six months. Without a full class of people, I could focus! I could go outside and do my work and finish a weeks worth in an hour and a half! I went back to regular school with enough credits that I could have already graduated, but I wanted to go to prom and stuff so I went back. My mom had zero interaction with this school. But the weird thing is she would tell me how proud she was of me for working hard to make it up. She almost never put me down for being in that school. The ONE thing she should have gotten mad about. W
So here's where it gets funny - she used to kick me out allllll the time. For various infractions. I think I was 14 the first time this happened. And then she'd call and beg me to come home and say she was sorry, and I was a fucking idiot doormat so I'd walk home with my tail between my legs and she'd cry and hug me and then the next day she'd be yelling again. ( Guess who's bipolar? But that's actually only a little relevant.) She would tell everyone at school that she didn't know what was going on with me, that I'd just disappear sometimes and not answer the phone and wouldn't tell her where I was going. School counselor called me in. By this time my mom didn't work for the district anymore and had switched careers. This counselor, who had already thought I was lazy and awful for having to go to the other school, mostly ignored me when I told her my mom was actually kicking me out and had hit me several times in the past and committed abuse by taking away ""privileges"", some as easy as TV and some like ""laundry and shower"". Didn't care. Thought I was acting up. Enter - me, 19. I am flunking my second semester of college after barely scraping by in the first. I hate college. I feel like an idiot and I'm not as put together as these other people. I flunk out and start working. I meet my FH just before I turned 21 and moved into his place 2 weeks later. His roommates all bail. In the interim, we have to find a place to stay. Guess who has the only open room in town? At least FH got to experience how she treated me. She only did it when she thought he wasn't there, but he's quiet. He saw and heard everything. We move out again. At that point, I'm 23 and completely unsure if I was actually ill or if she'd twisted it all up. It takes me two years to get help because A: I am scared and B: it takes me that long to actually call the abuse what it was. Turns out I'm not only ADHD and have full on depression, but I also have a panic disorder and show many signs of PTSD! I don't obviously tell her any of these. In the last two years, she has started pretending we have a great relationship now and she's always talking about how I'm ""sooo much better after getting help"" and that I was a terrible and difficult child to raise because of my ADHD and mood issues.

Ever since then i have been on and off of medications and treatment. I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist and getting treatment. But he is still treating me with depression and anxiety disorder. Its been about 8 months since I'm on many prescriptions. But i don't think its helping me. I'm still depressed. I constantly get suicidal ideation. My Mental state isnt improving. I feel like its getting worse. I did some research on my symptoms. I know self diagnosis or even looking these up arent good for my treatment, or so i have been told.

I apologize in advance. I had a breakdown in January 2011 and ended up being in the hospital 3 times that year. 2012 got a little better as I was finally able to figure out a medication combo that worked for me. I still wasn't feeling like I could work, but finally in September an opportunity arose that I couldn't pass up. Well, that opportunity has now ended. The business was really slow so they had to let a few people go. Here it is, a new year, and 4 days from the two-year anniversary of my breakdown. I really don't want it to happen again, but I'm not so sure I can be strong. I guess everything happens for a reason because since I've been working, I've been really bad about helping my son with his homework and turning it in on time. Now that I don't work, I will have more time to devote to that. I feel like a terrible mother because in spite of knowing that my son is at risk for retention of first grade, I haven't been able to get my act together and get on top of his homework. It's just such a battle getting him to do it and I just don't have the energy to argue with him. My ex-husband also dropped on me today that he wants to claim our younger son on taxes this year. He owes me thousands of dollars, doesn't follow our divorce agreement of 50/50, and doesn't pay any child support. He thinks just because he has the younger one 3 days a week and both every other weekend, and buys them clothes that he deserves one for taxes. The best part: He isn't even LEGAL! I checked the law, and it is in my favor, but this causes a rift between us and the last thing I need is to be fighting with him about stupid shit. Don't ask me how he can file taxes because I have no clue. But, he does it. That's my rant/story. Thank you for reading.",I lost my job today... I feel like a failure in all areas of my life.,0,6,1

The reason why I feel like the poor should have access to more is to ensure that their kids have access to everything they would need to bring themselves into a similar situation. You seem to have this idea that if we can not provide them with a similar experience to what people would pay for that we shouldn't even try to give them anything. I see that as just giving up. We have data and studies that the income/wealth gap is widening each year. The system (capitalism) is designed to widen the wealth gap. Capitalism with or without a govt overlooking it will eventually end up in a situation like we see today where 1% of the population owns a majority of the wealth. The middle class is unsustainable within capitalism.

Update I recieved the go ahead and approval for the post and the next one. I will post about regaining sensitivity and resetting triggers to something more innocent for those in the preteen and Teen age group. This one will be labeled NSFW Thread three will be a Misc. thread that covers things such as haircuts, clothing, eyelashes, etc. Hi there, You can call me Jimmy (Not my real name but a nickname after Jimmy Neutron because I was so smart as a kid and everyone called me that). I am 11 years old. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at 11 years old which is coincidence. Like many of you I really am mentally and emotionally that young. And I do experience body dysphoria and if I were to be given the opportunity to jump back into my 11 year old body permanently I would jump at it. However I am not suicidal about it as I am more the type to do something about it for myself and others And I value my own life to much to ever consider it. And I don't mean advocacy as that is better left to those who dedicate everything to it. I mean real Actionable things you can do right now to keep yourself looking younger and closer to your real age. And I don't mean makeup. ( Barring some blush on the cheeks for the older among us.) I wont lie some of this costs money, some of it a lot of money. Some of it is free and some of it can be risky. But for the youngest in body among us it could be the only way of keeping their dysphoria in check semi permanently. I will put warning next to anything potentially dangerous and the money needed if applicable and most of it will only apply to the US. It will range from rejuvenating your body, some of these will have permanent consequences so you must be absolutely sure you could not live without it. I wont lie without knowing about this topic in detail I had fantasized and looked into halting puberty at that age with no feasible options and no money if I had known about what I am going to tell you about I would have jumped consequences or not. I will also put sources for those that have them and I will update this list as new information appears or community members have things to add that would compliment things. So please comment if you have anything to add. Now we start with the section that while dicey in places will greatly benefit the physically youngest among us. I will not lie your on a time limit and a very restrictive one as every pubertal change is not something easily reversed. It is also understandable that many of you will simply not have the capital available. Seemingly at least. But there are things you can do and they will serve you well and many will be permanent. However, you must first be absolutely sure that you are age dysphoric and that it will kill you inside to not look at or close to your true age. As until regenerative medicine progresses further these changes will be permanent and irreversible. Talk to a Psychologist first and keep this in your back pocket but make sure as you are a child. In many cases both physically and mentally. It will be significantly easier for you if you have your parents and psych on your side. As you won't have to go to cloak and dagger route and agonize on how to pay for things. Broach the idea slowly and carefully leverage your autism diagnosis if you have it. Make it abundantly clear that you will be destroyed if you physically grow up but don't get too whiny about it make your case that you already feel dysphoric in your body as it gets older and does not match your mental age. Bargain if you need to, make it clear that you're still going to study and put your best foot forward to get a job. If at any point unless your autism is that severe you make it known that you want to be taken care of like a child beyond love and affection your attempt will sour as many parents don't want that kind of burden. Remember it is more important that you keep your body looking how it should look. This way you can go through with the steps I'm going to list below but with parental approval and backing and hopefully a physician's supervision. You could even use the surprisingly low price as a selling point. If at the point you put your feelers forward you can see it would never be approved of or they would do horrible things to you, you will have to go to cloak and dagger route this is easier than it seems. The hardest part of the whole thing is getting a hold of the money. You can make this money by hopefully doing household chores and saving up as the first step will not take a lot of money. Otherwise you can perform a side hustle or ask around your neighborhood if anyone needs any chores done. You Will only need around $30 dollars on a visa gift card for this one and a safe place to send it to. Or better yet as part of your chores start bringing in the mail. This will give you chance to hide what you bought and use it later. When you've decided you've reached old enough what is the first thing on your to do list? Closing Bone Growth Plates. Girls have the short stick on this one is their growth finishes earlier than boys. With most reaching adult height at around 15. So the earlier the better for this one. Boys have a bit more leeway but the sooner it is done the younger you will look. There are two moderately safe ways to close the growth plates. High doses of estrogen or testosterone. An easily attainable way to do this is by taking a large and measured dose of birth control. Even the boys though you may have to worry about growing breasts if you continue doing so. If you have the option to though it might be more expensive it will be much better in the long term take the testosterone option instead. A very high initial dose will close the growth plates. Certain SARMS will also do so. But if you are low on time and money you need to take what you can get. [ <URL>](<URL>) You can get all of this from alldaychemist 2. Puberty Blockers and Anti Androgens: If you've gotten to this point hopefully you have your parents support as then you will be able to pursue the most ideal option which is an implant called ## [SUPPRELIN LA](<URL>) It will completely suppress puberty for at least one year. Without more permanent and damaging ways of preventing puberty this is the most sustainable and long term solution. With luck you can pretend to be gender dysphoric and just say you need time, that way the doctors will not only go out of their way to prescribe it for you but insurance just may cover it. Otherwise if you are very understanding doctors you may be able to get it anyways. Avoid Lupron though as the long-term side effects are coming out as very bad. If you are unable to get a hold of the other puberty blockers you may have to go the anti-androgen route. There is a tab dedicated to it on all day chemist. You can find Sarms on Science. Bio but expect to spend at least 70$. There is a possibility the implants can last for more than one year which would be even better. [ <URL>](<URL>) If you are able to do both of these things, you should basically be set. If you are already older than your real age at least you can prevent any more damage. For the older ones among us. Now we start with the first thing that will actually rejuvenate your skin and make you look physically younger. This will be expensive up front but the cost will lessen after the initial investment as you will only need to purchase certain items occasionally. Skin Care Shopping List and Rationale: 1:) Tretinoin : This is the most important part of the regimen, if you purchase nothing else or can afford nothing else this is what you should buy. It is one of the most scientifically studied skincare ingredients with decades of research outside of cosmetic companies. It is not a magic cure but over the course of several months of consistent application it will reduce and eliminate skin blemishes and wrinkles and help prevent the formation of new ones. Put a pea-sized dab on your face before you go to bed. Source Alldaychemist around 8$ per tube no prescription needed. Since starting to apply it my nascent frown lines have halfed. 2:) Skin Medica TNS recovery complex: This is the second most important part of the regimen. It is also the most expensive. It is a solution of over 300 growth factors and cytokines taken from human fibroblasts and is proven when applied over the course of around six weeks to double skin thickness and further reduce and eliminate wrinkles. Since starting to apply this my cheeks have gotten a little bigger and my eyelids have begun to look Dewey again. It is applied twice a day once at night and once in the morning and the single bottle will usually last 2 to 3 months. You may feel a slight burning sensation applying it after tretinoin. You should wait 30 minutes after applying tretinoin to apply this. These two are the only to you needed night. Source: Various sources Skin Medica. Price $60-200 Be careful of scams if going for the cheaper option. It should smell odd and a little organic or it is not real. 3:) Sunscreen: It should be Zinc Oxide and titanium Based. Source Various Price Various. 30-50 SPF 4:) AHA Cream: Morning exfoliation, in studies is proven to accelerate the the results of tretinoin as it operates by a different mechanism. Should be applied in the morning. Price various source various. 5:) Vitamin C Cream: This one should be simple, mono ingredient, and cheap. Apply after AHA and before sunscreen. 6:) Silk Pillowcases: As you get older you iron in wrinkles as you sleep on your side and your collagen production gets weaker. Cotton also sucks out the moisture from your face. The only thing proven in studies to not cause ironed in wrinkles is silk. You can also buy a silk eye mask. I myself use the one from Manta. Word of caution it should be silk not satin, this distinction is very important it should say only one hundred percent silk. 7:) A simple lotion for your body. I use Lush Cosmetics solid body lotion myself. Cost $12 8:) a simple body retinoid. I myself use something called retinoil which is $20. This will fade imperfections in your body. I am still trying to find something that will further fade white stretch marks and I will update this if I can. You can find this at your local drugstore usually. 9:) The last thing for skincare and the one that should only be used when you have discontinued the retinoids or anything that could make you more sensitive to light. Also the thing that could help a lot of us the most. I am talking about laser hair removal or any form of permanent hair removal. A lot of my discomfort would leave me if I did not have to look at body and pubic hair. And I'm certain that a lot of you feel the same. This one can take multiple sessions and until recently left out those who were darker skinned and have lighter hair colors. More recent advancements have made it available for them to. However is expensive and requires multiple sessions. A more permanent but just as expensive and little more lengthy procedure is called electrolysis. This one kills the hair follicle. But it can be painful. The cost for this one can be iffy. You might have to game the system and pretend to have gender dysphoria to get hair removal covered by insurance. You're only half lying as you do suffer from dysphoria (unless you also suffer from gender dysphoria). Otherwise you are looking at a minimum investment of $2000 but it will be probably be closer to $6000 the good news is that this is basically a one time expense. Once it is done you at most have to perform some maintenance sessions every few months in certain areas but you may not have to do it all. Edit: (2/09/21) 10:) In addition to the retinoid for the body I have found one thing that is empirically backed for the fading of stretch marks. It is something called bio-oil. They have a website. Now we move on to health and Exercises: Little Boys and Girls are generally thin and limber. And if you were able to portray that image and demonstrate that ability you will be looked at as younger. Thin does not necessarily mean super skinny as if you are too thin you will look much older than you really are and cause severe health issues and damage to yourself that will make you look older. A notable example are some of the pictures you see of vegan men in San Francisco. A lot of them look like Holocaust victims and even though many of them are in their early 20s they look like they're in their 50s. For that reason unless you do it for religious reasons I cannot recommend veganism at all as none of their assertions about health hold up to scrutiny and the ""studies"" are often found to be fraudulent. Now if you were on a vegan diet for moral reasons I commend you but just know you are making things harder for yourself. Vegetarianism is doable but will require supplementation and Eggs. Most of us here seem to be on the autism spectrum. For that reason and it's 30 years of study despite its detractors I recommend you begin a gluten-free casein free diet. It helped clear up bowel issues I have had forever. And cleared up Acne I have had on my arms for as long as I can remember. Follow the caloric intake recommendation for your age and sex unless you are overweight. In that case you must operate at a caloric deficit. A good cookbook to follow is this one [<URL> amp;psc=1](<URL> amp;psc=1) I also greatly recommend the autism nutrition research Center Regiment. [ <URL>](<URL>) it can be expensive but it is research-based, and it is no more expensive than each of the ingredients purchased separately. Sleep: Little boys and girls have bed times. That means 9 o'clock sharp no exceptions. ( Unless you work) You should be getting the 10 hours of sleep your body demands. This means practicing good sleep hygiene such as taking your electronics out of your room buying and using bluelight glasses. Installing bluelight filters on your electronics. Combined with the skincare regimen above this should alleviate your dark circles which should make you seem younger. The idea that increase sleep lessons your lifespan has been disproven. Exercise: Little Boys and Girls Club are fit, thin and limber. Generally as well they have round perky bottoms and thin appendages. Depending on your build, getting too thin can actually be counterproductive and make you look older. I am not going to lie even if you do everything perfectly and manage to do everything I am listing and will continue to list your build will limit how young you can look. But You can optimize your physique to make yourself look younger. Everything should be mostly proportional, for example if you are big and bulky your arms and legs should be within the range of the rest your body. You should have muscle but it should not be well-defined, but you should also try to limit fat as much as you can but not too much as a small layer of fat can stand in for baby fat if controlled properly. It will take some doing but the ideal is to be proportional with a small layer of fat to create a slightly chubby childish look. That does not mean you should be chubby just that it should be look like you have baby fat. I mentioned it earlier one of the big things people overlook and will give you a way if nothing else does is your butt. Children almost universally up to the late teenage years have well-defined and rounded glutes. Some people would call this diaper butt even though no diapers are involved. This is especially true for boys, and is this perspective I'm speaking from. There are other guides for women but the ideal is you want to avoid making your thighs bigger while making your butt perkier. [ <URL>](<URL>) This website is a good place to start and is funnily enough aimed at women. Another place to look is a website and workout plan called autism fitness. Some of them are useless if you are not developmentally delayed enough for them but others are perfect for our purpose as our goal is to gain lean muscle and flexibility not bulk. For me personally I do bear walks, dead bugs, squats, sidesteps, glue bridges both weighted and unweighted, Russian swings, overhead band presses, and moderate weight bench presses. Ultimately the exercises that are perfect for you, you have to find in your own. There is a last exercise I can recommend to everyone that will definitely make you look younger and further reduce the appearance of wrinkles if you have them and prevent their appearance if you don't. It is called facial yoga. Basically it's an exercise routine for your facial muscles primarily your cheeks, this avoids the sunken look and if you start young enough or will you still have enough volume you can preserve and look much younger than you normally would even with the steps mentioned above. Combining these with some of the geroprotectors, research chemicals, and other substances in the next section and depending on how old you look you will be able to target a presenting age. Which while probably not your actual age should be significantly better than what you experience currently. Calm down look at yourself in the mirror and see what you can fix and change. How old will that make you look? Make that your target. For a lot of us that presenting age will be somewhere in your teens. Not ideal but significantly better than would be possible otherwise. For myself based on my old photos and what I currently look like in my early 20s I could easily shoot for and maintain the looks of someone who is 14. With a stretch goal if some of the things I am investigating pan out of 13 to 12. If I could make it to looking like I was 12 I would be within spitting distance of my actual age and I would be happy with it. But if it doesn't 14 will have to do. When I say 12 I mean what I look like when I was 12 same thing with 14. You could easily just say you're a tall kid. I will hopefully coin a phrase: Your Presenting Age Goal. The goal of looking as close to your true age as is feasibly possible. Geroprotectors and other research compounds: Geroprotectors are compounds that prevent and reverse aging in physical adults. They include peptides, regenerative medicine, and certain research chemicals and non-FDA approved pharmaceuticals which are safe and tested elsewhere. A big thing to look at are the Khavinson peptides. Many of them have studies behind them to present their efficacy and they were developed for the Soviet Union super soldier program which became defunct after the fall. If you have heard of elderly individuals having young blood plasma transfusions to be young again these peptides operate upon the same principle. They make your body repair itself. One in particular would be very important especially among those who have had a destroyed sleep schedule and want to present as younger. That is Endoluten the Pineal Peptide. This extends the telomeres of the body and more importanly fixes your circadian rhythms so you will fall asleep and wake up as a child with the falling of darkness and coming of day. Looks are only half the equation, the other half is how you outwardly present in one of the best ways to seem younger even if you don't look it is hyperactivity. For that reason the adrenal peptide GlandoKort also comes recommended as it will restore some of that hyperactivity. The only other two I would recommend as essential, depending on your individual needs of course is ventfort the blood vessel peptide. Increased blood flow to areas will not only make you more alert it will also make you look younger by renewing the blood supply in places and giving you that childish blush. And Sigumir the cartilage peptide. This will not only have an extremely positive effect in your skin but more importantly shore up your cartilage and allow you to increase your flexibility and further reduce the age you present as. [ <URL>](<URL>) I buy mine from here, but if you look you can find it elsewhere. Make sure to buy the Russian branding not the American branding as the 60 capsules only come with the Russian. Now we move on from generally safe peptides to the riskier research chemicals. This post as long as heck as it is so I will only list each chemical what it can do for you how it can make you present as younger and safety considerations. NSI-189: Your emotions will be more intense and much more like a child's, you may be mentally a child but your body's hormones may have ""matured"" out of that stage causing an emotional disconnect. It was investigated first as a smart drug by DARPA and is now being developed and marketed as an atypical antidepressant but it is not an SSRI. It will improve your memory and make it more like a child's as its primary mechanism of action is by increasing BDNF and increasing the size of the hippocampus. This one has been tested extensively and its effective dose is 40 mg increasing the dosage will not increase the effects it will actually lessen the effects. You can look up any contradictions in scientific studies performed upon this. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I currently take this one. 9-me-bc: As long as you don't do drugs you will take greater pleasure and every day things and will restore ""the magic"". Many of you probably were put on ADHD medication, this works by down regulating dopamine receptors. This research chemicals on the other hand has been found to regenerate them even dead ones. You only need to take it for at most six weeks and you will need to avoid the sun like a vampire or put on sunscreen in that time. But the results are completely worth it. If you search on Reddit you might find traces of it being viewed as neurotoxic. There is no evidence of this as all compunds in this class do not have the same effect. Preliminary in vitro testing actually shows a neuroprotective effect. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I also took this one but only for six weeks to repair early damage of ADHD medication. Cerebrolysin: I recently learned that I suffered from trauma induced alexithymia. PTSD, depression, and other traumas are actually a form of brain damage. This Russian peptide medication is primarily prescribed for that purpose. It is very safe and is been in use for over 70 years and has more than 400 human studies in several hundred more on animals. Why haven't you heard about it than? Because none of the studies are in English and the FDA doesn't consider any study not done in English to be credible. ( Yes I am serious) I recently finished a 30 day regimen of Cerebrolysin for 30 days. It did three big things for me. It restored my ability to feel emotions though I still need to learn interoception skills I never learned. It further expanded my awareness of the world and of myself. And it reopened the development period allowing me to start recognizing facial micro expressions and other conversational nuances that were beyond me before. It is also what gave me the awareness to realize I was an 11-year-old flying by the seat of his pants and gave me the nuance to look back on some of my actions ""growing up"" in a new light. I had always sought to recapture my childhood and remained looking as young as possible. A lot of my past and current behavior started to make sense in hindsight and present more evidence that I was mentally 11 even if I was intellectually much older. The benefit of this is you will better be able to judge situations and physically and emotionally express yourself which will serve the purpose of making you seem younger and simultaneously more polite so even if the people you're talking to see through you they are more likely give you the benefit of the doubt. It is intramuscularly injected so you will need to take time to learn how to do it safely if you so choose. Remember there is no pressure and you can take or leave whatever I present to you. The only legitimate source in the West to buy it is Rupharma. For older individuals that are of course numerous hormonal and other interventions you can partake in but I will not list them as they are up to you. That is all I have for now. I hope it can help some people.

s_2237_1043,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"My best friend/wife killed herself 2 years ago and I wish my anger would go away. This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink. We will call her Jenny for this. When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend. My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off. I DID NOT have sex with her. I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time. I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time. My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend. I'm not stupid; they fucked. And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try. Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing. I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude. Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal. When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence. Sometimes objects would entrance her. She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty. All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time. Oh and don't forget the octopus hat. I loved her so deeply. In a non-romantic way. Jenny had problems in her past. Her family was not very supportive of her. I think they just didn't know what to do. Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so. The school didn't know what to do with her either. Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note. Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important. Jenny was highly, highly intelligent. She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could. Johnny Five seriously yo. Jenny had problems socializing with others. She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with. After a while Jenny lost her job. She was fired for poor customer service. After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills. And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her. I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance. So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse. I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance. And she agreed. So that is what we did. At first it was great. Jenny was excited about us moving. Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment. But she was okay with this. Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war. Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me. What would she do if I died? Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people? And the news kept getting worse. She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens. About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you. About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....
Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank. Her ability to absorb data was astounding. She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained. So all this dark bad news she absorbed. When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house. I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean. The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq. She continued to refuse to see a doctor. But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go. Oh my goodness the meltdowns. Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone. The government is listening. She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet. Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you. The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests. The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings. Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence. She should have been inventing fusion reactors....
But Jenny was also autistic. Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism. The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk. But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism. Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school. Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books. The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable. Jenny refused any type of medication. OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you. I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants. So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State. The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent. So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country. The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home. So I went. I was gone for about one month. The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown. Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her. This hurt so bad. I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains. She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! And then she hung up the phone. She had done this many many times before. Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards. So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny. The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state. The social worker was not answering her phone either. So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning. Jenny was still mad; not answering her phone. While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself? And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief. Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that. I loved Jenny so much. I just wanted her to be happy. To recapture that innocence and wonder she had. To live life without mistreatment from others. I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her. There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude. I interfered with one telling the customer to back off. Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me. Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors. That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor. Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello. I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start. So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got. No answer. But she's done this before. I kept telling myself she would be okay. But that evening, I could not take it anymore. So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her. The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone. He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there. I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house. He said okay and that he would call me back. Five minutes passed. A goddamn eternity it was. I called the cops phone. No answer. Ten minutes passed. Fucking cop won't answer the phone. Twenty minutes passed. Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone. So I call the neighbor. Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good. With that information I tell myself. Jenny is dead. Finally the cop calls. He says, I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead. She hung herself. The body is cold so we did not try CPR. An ambulance is on its way. We then hung up. I couldn't believe it. I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning. I thought somehow that is what caused this. Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything. She was my best friend. She was just an innocent bunny. I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house. And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet. And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash. Jenny hung herself with it. And then I wept some more for about an hour. Walking around the now empty house. I was abandoning it. I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time. So I let it foreclose. But anyway. I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall. I just wanted Jenny back. Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten. I cried like I never cried before. I was slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess. And then suddenly it stopped. And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny. And I'm still angry. It was just such a waste. She was so damn smart. Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries. And she just quit life like that. She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left. No note or anything left behind. What in the FUCK Jenny??????? And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it. I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore. And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now. My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines. But dammit I'm still so mad at her. I wish I could feel something other than anger. Because I loved her and now she's gone. She just fucking quit and left. So that's it. Its off my chest I guess. Not really. I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do. I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else. And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny. What the fuck? My prayer. TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy. :p. I asked nicely...
Edit: what's with all the fucking hate mail? I followed the doctors advice. I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her. I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry. I gave her everything she ever asked for and more. If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy. Grow some balls. (Wait no those are weak) grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man. Wait.... what? Edit2: writing this was incredibly therapeutic. It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go. I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet. I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments. I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be. But at least the heart squeezing is gone.

You always hear story about how the roommate of the girl who commits suicide automatically gets straight A's. That's about all you ever hear about that girl, the one who walks in and finds the other one that way. Being back home feels weird, but at first I didn't care. I just wanted to sleep in my own bed and stay in the dark away from everyone. Almost nothing changed at home since I left. The house was exactly the same. In fact, the only change was that mom didn't do her own vacuuming every day now, since she bought one of those stupid ""Roomba"" things from a Skymall magazine. I slept most of the day and night. My parents worried about me. They brought me food and offered to take me places, but I always said no - the most I could manage was to read a few posts on Reddit while avoiding Facebook and the torrent of memorials from her recently acquired array of ""best friends"" there - before rolling over and falling back into a warm, dreamless sleep. The police came to question me again. I took a shower for the first time in recent memory and faced the off-colored light of the day. My glasses were off and music was playing in my room. As I walked down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, I stepped onto something. It was *alive*. I squealed and retreated into my room, the creature hissed and squirmed off down the hall. I still don't understand why they bought a white Roomba for cleaning their white carpet. The police said that there was new information, and asked me a bunch of weird questions about the room we shared and the rest of the dorm building. They kept asking if we knew of anyone who kept animals in the dorms, especially something like a snake or anything that laid eggs. I started to feel lightheaded and like the world was too bright for me. I just got back to bed before I started hyperventilating. I'm exhausted. It sounds lame, I know - I was up for all of three hours. Now that I'm in bed, I'm being kept up by the hissing, whirring sound of the Roomba. It's trapped in my room, and I'm too lazy to get up and open the door. The other thing that's keeping me awake is the strange way that Lucy was acting in the week before she died. She never was one to go out all the time, but that last week, she kept the curtains drawn and I don't think she ever left the room. Maybe there was something else wrong with her, like she was poisoned or...

<URL>
I won't be trying it just yet but there isn't much you can do with a stubborn problem other that to experiment. Your sleep pattern sounds a little like mine in that I would get up to 3-4 nights of half-reasonable sleep in a row and then it would suddenly drop out for no apparent reason. I had recently stopped taking Amitriptylene (Elavil) and things got a lot worse. I then restarted the Elavil along with magnesium which I started taking about 3 weeks ago. My sleep pattern hasn't improved much but my mood is far better and I can cope on the sleep I get. I think that the main thing that is working is the magnesium as I never felt so alert on just Elavil. If you haven't tried it then Magnesium may be worth a shot. Use either Magnesium Citrate or Taurate an hour before bed for a couple of weeks. Any extra Mg will pass out through the kidneys so as long as they are functioning OK there shouldn't be a problem. 60 capsules cost about £10 on Amazon so it is an easy and cheap option to try. I am not sure it will work with PTSD but you gotta keep trying things. I think that Mg works mostly for depression of which a secondary symptom is insomnia. I assume you have spent time with a psychologist/counsellor to work through the PTSD issues, but if not then maybe that is worth a shot as well. Good luck with the acupuncture, I hope it works for you and I would be interested in hearing the result.",I had recently stopped taking Amitriptylene (Elavil) and things got a lot worse.,455,9,1

I added this to the first post but Ill put it here as well. It is the note and picture the only thing I have that the police didnt take [proof](<URL>)
So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------
**UPDATE**
So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------
**FINAL UPDATE**
So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and ""earn my dinner"". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in.",I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time.,9000,0,1

s_891_398,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Deleted for being non-horror Yesterday started like any other day. I woke up, took a shower, and got dressed before telling my wife goodbye and headed off to work. My wife always thought I worked as a financial consultant. Frankly, I dont think she ever really cared what I did, but that worked out even better for me. You see, I have a unique job. I am a contract killer, but I only deal with suicidal people finish the job. Of course, I make them send me a copy of their id and three photos holding up specific items to prove they are who they are. The job came with two main perks. 1) Job security: I never ran out of clientele. Word spreads. They never knew who I was, but I made it an easy process for the people that needed my services. 2) A semi-clear conscience: Killing anyone is a terrible thing. Suicide is never the answer, but in my opinion, if someone goes through that much work to kill themselves they are going to find another way anyways. Plus, they have the option of picking when and where their death will take place. I always make sure they have a quick and painless death. I had one man to take care of today. His name was Matthew Johnson. His wife left him and took their kids with her. His business was failing. He was down to his last 20k. Matthew couldnt even pay all of his employees by the end of this month. Thats why he contacted me. I charged him the regular rate of 15k. Once I received the payment from him I gave him the call to alert him that he only had 10 minutes to live. I was sitting on a hill about 300 yards away from the entrance to his company. Nine minutes later, he walked out. I looked through my scope and aimed at the middle of his head. My phone vibrated, but I ignored it and started to steady my breath. I took a deep breath and squeezed the trigger right as I started to exhale. Matthews body became limp. The back of his head sprayed blood all over the entrance door and he fell over. I took apart my sniper and put it back in my briefcase before running into the woods. I ran the three-mile distance to get to the other side of the woods and towards the shopping mall I parked at. When I got to my car I put my briefcase in my trunk and grabbed the spare t-shirt from the back seat of my car. I quickly changed into the fresh shirt before walking into the mall. It was about 45 minutes past 12 so I walked into the mall and walked to the food court to pick up some lunch. When I got my medium pizza and large coke I took my seat and checked my business phone. It was from a number I recognized the minute I saw it. It was my wifes phone number. I opened the message and read the message before dropping the phone on the table. She needed my services. I wanted to text back, but I didnt know how to respond back to
*Hello. My name is Amber Jefferson. I need your help. I dont have anything to live for anymore. My husband has been getting more and more distant with me. My friends have stopped talking to me. Both of my parents are dead. I was fired from my job, and I do not have any reason to keep living.* After thinking while I finished my pizza I decided to text her back. I asked, Can you send me a photo of your id? Three minutes later, I received a photo of her id from her number. After I checked the id I sent her another text asking, Can you send me 3 separate photos. The first one of you holding a can of Mello Yello, the next photo of you holding a bag of sour cream and onion flavored sunflower seeds and the last photo of you and your husband. I received two photos from you within 7 minutes. After I received the photo of her holding a can of Mello Yello and a bag of Sour Cream and Onion Sunflower seeds she sent me a message saying that she would be able to send me the last photo tonight. I came home at 8 pm that night. When I got home, I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sighed before I put up the can of Mello Yello and bag of sunflower seeds. I walked up to my room and got comfortable in the bed. I turned on the tv and started to relax when I received a picture. It was a photo of my wife lying next to me in bed. There is the last photo messaged right after the photo. I kept the phone pressed towards my stomach in case she managed to see. After I saw the photo I turned off both of my phones and fell asleep. This morning, I woke up and knew that today was going to be rough. I turned on my business phone and instantly received a text from my wife. *I will be standing in front of the address written on my id. You know how to get rid of me. Do it at precisely 12:04 pm.* I checked the time and jumped out of bed when I realized it was 11:58 am. I sent her a text that said, Okay. Free of charge. When I ran out to the living room I greeted my wife the same way I did for the past 2 years. I kissed the only photo I had of her. The photo I took of her the day before she shot herself on our front lawn. With a sigh, I took the photo off of my wall and gave it a final kiss before taking the photo out of the frame and ripping it up. After I tore it up i threw it into my fireplace and watched it become smoke. While I wiped away a couple of tears from my eyes I received another text from my wife. I opened up the text. It simply said two words. Two final words. [""Thank You] (<URL>).""",I dont have anything to live for anymore.,2824,8,1

TITLE: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition depressed VENT. I don't know why I am up this late and I am ashamed to be posting this (and probably will regret this later) but I got to get a few things off my chest. THIS IS HELLA LONG BUT I APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN READ LEND A PAIR OF EYES/HEARTS. JUST NEED TO VENT. As the title suggests I am 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition depressed. By squatters' conditions I mean:
Living in a house that had two fires almost 10 years ago/on-going construction. Living without heat, running/drinking water, shower/tub, toilet, stove/gas. Aka can't shower, cook, or shit properly. Living in a living room/sleeping on couches with my parents. This is where we eat, sleep, ""lounge""
How I got here/Where I was: Almost a year ago. Got laid off unexpectedly. I was very unprofessional at this job and surprised I didn't get fired (due to depression). Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise. Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope. Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working. For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety. Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies. I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill. Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money. Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression. Where I am/Present day:
Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August. Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$
Dad has full-time job. Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs. Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now. Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months. Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Constant fights. Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone. Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much. Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor. Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings. This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my ""reality""; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies I don't think I can face reality head on. LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME
Get a full time job

TITLE: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition depressed VENT. I don't know why I am up this late and I am ashamed to be posting this (and probably will regret this later) but I got to get a few things off my chest. THIS IS HELLA LONG BUT I APPRECIATE ANYONE WHO CAN READ LEND A PAIR OF EYES/HEARTS. JUST NEED TO VENT. As the title suggests I am 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition depressed. By squatters' conditions I mean:
Living in a house that had two fires almost 10 years ago/on-going construction. Living without heat, running/drinking water, shower/tub, toilet, stove/gas. Aka can't shower, cook, or shit properly. Living in a living room/sleeping on couches with my parents. This is where we eat, sleep, ""lounge""
How I got here/Where I was: Almost a year ago. Got laid off unexpectedly. I was very unprofessional at this job and surprised I didn't get fired (due to depression). Weird but kinda saw this as a blessing in disguise. Mom got fired (again) from part-time job, lost apartment we all had to move back to the house. Mom previously left Dad after first fire. My mom has lost hope. Dad living paycheck to paycheck, constantly working. For months before internship, half-assingly looked for apartments, sublets, full-times jobs, but never really followed through because of depression, fear, and anxiety. Have savings but don't want to touch in case of emergencies. I am very disciplined when it comes to money. I save constantly and can pay for food/phone bill. Fear of being broke; also makes me afraid to spend money. Been battling diagnosed depression for 5+ years. I had a counselor for 2 1/2 years and she told me she things I have major depression. Where I am/Present day:
Let go from internship recently after a long bout of unemployment due to small non-profit budget reasons. Got let go in early August. Mom has part-time job. Before then used to help out/give her $$$
Dad has full-time job. Again half-assingly looking for apartments, sublets, and jobs. Actually have 2 job interviews today but I am not sure I am going (fear, developing slight Agoraphobia). Not sure if I want a job now. Managed to save money from internship (already on top of savings from last job). I can live off these savings for a couple of months. Family is divided. Father stubborn and overworked. Mother hopeless and slightly irresponsible. Constant fights. Feel alone, that no one has my back, that I can't trust anyone. Resentment, betrayal, anger, sadness/mixed feelings, towards parents/family. My parents has let me down so much. Don't have confidence in myself/ going out on my own because I don't have anyone to truly fall back on if I fail. 1st world poor. Now that I got the backstory out the way it's time for feelings. This past couple of months have been the worst of my life. I have never felt soo lost and soo weak ever. On days that I didn't have my internship I used be afraid to leave my house. I only survived at my internship because my fear of being completely broke outweighs my fear of being outside. Towards the end of my internship it has gotten way worst (my developing Agoraphobia). I say developing because I can physically go outside it's just that I need to mentally distract myself (playing games on phone, listening to music, reading). I even experienced silent freakouts at my internship. The house has made me a bit crazy. Thoughts racing, constant stomachaches when I think about my ""reality""; feeling unhinged/unsafe. The only way I can relax myself is Netflix. I have developed escapist tendencies I don't think I can face reality head on. LOGIC/HEAD IS TELLING ME

I had seen something so rare and it was thrown back at me. 4 years later, I still feel like I have no answers. I still struggle to understand what I have seen. I contacted MUFON. The lady I spoke with was very interested in what I had to tell her. She sounded very eager to hear what I had seen. I'd like to also say, I've seen things in the sky before, but only way up high.

If it's not by jumping off, it will be with their belt around their neck, hanging in their closet. We live in a world that indirectly encourages suicide. The ""worthy"" ones should get all the good stuff, while the mediocre ones could die and no one would care. On top of that, very few people actually believe they're actually worthy. Now, in some countries, it's way worse because sometimes those words are said directly to people (thinking about Japan and South Korea). However in America the continent, Africa ... all around the world, there are so few resources known to the general population that could indeed save someone's life by said individual's choice. I wish there was such a thing as an organization who's purpose is to help people who feel down and suicidal to find some purpose in their life.

s_170_138,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Just signed up for my first race and it's in 3 WEEKS! This past summer I joined a boxing gym and fell in love with working out. I was going 3-5 times a week, started to get in great shape and felt better about myself than I ever had. But then I got injured and took some time off from the gym. Immediately following that, I went on vacation for a week and did zero work outs. I came home with a terrible sunburn and sun poisoning, which kept me out for another week. I ended up being out for over a month. That was July, and I'm still struggling to get back into a routine, I can hardly manage getting to the gym once a week now. I've also gained weight, and I'm not 10 lbs higher than my original start weight! This is what hurts most. I worked so hard and it's all disappeared. My plan at the beginning of the year was to look better for this holiday season than I did the last. I just got married in February and wore a size 16 dress. My new goal is to be at a size 10 for my 1 year anniversary. The thing is, it's not even just about looks and dress sizes. Heart disease and diabetes runs on both sides of my family. I want to be healthy enough to live a long, fulfilling life with my husband and raise a family. To help cure myself of this, I just singed up for my first 5k. It's not much but I've never ran that far before. Given that I paid the entry fee, I'm hoping it will light a fire under me and get me back into a solid training routine. I'm so nervous but at the same time I havnt stopped smiling since I registered. God, I hope this doesn't blow up in my face. I'm so tired of failing and starting over again.

But the last 6 or so months has been the most incredible roller coaster ride of emotions for me. From feeling absolutely rock bottom and ready to go to top of the world invincible. Early this year around the beginning of February I moved from Texas where I've lived 25+ years. A majority of my life. Currently 29. My gf at the time had kicked me out. Long story short, she was incredibly selfish and didnt have the time or patience to deal with someone with depression and anxiety. As I had no where else to go I ended up moving to Kansas to stay with my grandparents until I could get back on my feet. Ive had a few jobs while I've been here and it was never meant to be a permanant thing. There were weeks where I wanted to do nothing but lay in bed and just cry at what a failure I've been my entire life. Here I am almost 30 years old and I have practically nothing to show for it. Constantly thinking in the back of my mind it would be so much better to just give up. But I didnt. I only made one friend that I actually hung out with while I've been here and never had any intention of getting into a relationship with anyone until I got my self under control and moved on emotionally from my now ex gf. As of today, I havent spoken with my friend in a good month or two after we had a small falling out. I tried to make it clear that I wasnt looking for a relationship having moved here and was using this oppurtunity to work on myself get back on my feet and ready to move on from a broken relationship. That seemed to have backfired on me after we ended up sleeping together and I guess gave them the wrong idea. So I backed away and we havent spoken to each other since. My grandparents were kind enough to let me live with them for the good portion of this year and all I've managed to do is dig myself into hole after hole. They helped me get a car after I got a job. With the agreement that I keep up on my car payments and insurance. Ive fucked that up completely. When I first moved here I found a job working for a company I worked at back home. I got rides to and from work from my grandparents until I saved a bit of money to start looking for a car. My grandparents and I decided to go to carmax and get a reliable car riding on their good standing credit with them paying a decent down payment that I would repay them when I was able to. I soon left that job for a better job. About 3 months into the new job the stress started to get to me and I was having anxiety attacks at work lasting almost 3 hours. I had to leave. I got nothing but flak for quitting my job about how I shouldve found a job before leaving and so on. But the anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately after I left. My only thought at the time was Id rather get a little behind on bills than end up in the hospital for freaking out or something and hurting myself. After about 2 or 3 weeks of looking for a less stressful job and knowingly falling behind on my car payments I went and found a job working at Amazon here. Seeing as I had worked for them 2 years prior I knew I would have no trouble getting a job. But still my time was short. I had until the end of Sept to find a place to go regardless. It just seems like they wanted instant gratification and expected me to fix everything overnight. Even after I had explained no matter what approach I take it was going to take time and wasnt going to happen overnight. My grandma recently had to be hospitalized for a minor heart attack attributed to stress. Somehow I feel partly responsible and it makes me feel like a piece of shit. I gave my grandma a heart attack. But, I can honestly say the last 2 months I havent had one suicidal thought at all. Ive been in good spirits for the most part. I enjoy working at my job knowing my time was short and I would have to find somewhere to go. So here I am. Im moving this friday 3.5 hours away to the other side of Missouri to stay with someone I recently met. Someone who has shown me more love than all of the people in my life up to this point. I will have to find a job there as soon as I can. Behind on my bills. Very little money. With my grandma telling me if I miss one car payment I'm going to lose my car because she apparently cares more about her near perfect credit score than the well being of her eldest grandchild. Yet, I fear I am and will always be a failure. I fear I will never be in a place in my life where I am truly happy. No matter how hard I try or how far I get I fear Im always going to be held down and made to feel like nothing. The only thing I dont fear at this point is death. Which cant come soon enough.",No matter how hard I try or how far I get I fear Im always going to be held down and made to feel like nothing.,4525,6,1

Sure, sex is probably overrated, but I don't want a relationship solely for sex. To get someone of the opposite sex to want to be intimate with you is one of THE most important traits of being viewed as a functional person. People couldn't give two shits if you think you're alright for not having ever had an intimate relationship as it implies that there's something wrong with you, and people don't like that; they don't like someone like that hanging around them.

s_785_198,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"I'm not commenting so much on sex as I am on finding an intimate relationship. Sure, sex is probably overrated, but I don't want a relationship solely for sex. To get someone of the opposite sex to want to be intimate with you is one of THE most important traits of being viewed as a functional person. People couldn't give two shits if you think you're alright for not having ever had an intimate relationship as it implies that there's something wrong with you, and people don't like that; they don't like someone like that hanging around them. If you are just looking to get your dick wet, it shouldn't be that difficult, but will still require effort.

Normally, people who struggle with emotional stability (and can't stay happy) are told to do the things that they enjoy the very most when they start to feel under the weather psychologically, but my level of emotional sensitivity doesn't allow me to do that without often traumatic results. If anything at all goes wrong, it can and will ruin my mood at the moment, for the day, or even for the week. If a video-game session doesn't go exactly like I wanted, if the pizza I ordered isn't made the way I had hoped, if I want to play with my cat and she bites me because she wants to be left alone... things like these (mostly, but not always) make me want to crawl in a hole and cry, as if something tragic had happened. Living life for me is like tip-toeing around a field of landmines everywhere I go, which makes me want to do the only thing I know won't set off my anxiety-- lay in bed, in the dark, and do absolutely nothing. This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Which seem like it will turn into a pipe dream soon, since I have no health insurance and can't afford any since I'm unemployed. I have no idea how to manage this.

I started on Cypro and Estradiol 6 weeks ago, 12.5 mg and 1mg respectively, as a starter dose. This is to see if I experience any side effects and then we can raise my dose if I'm feeling okay. I was working really hard to be healthy at the start. I am on a fairly strict diet to make sure I'm eating enough and healthily (while still losing weight at a reasonable rate). I was doing cardio every day. I stopped smoking and drinking. The last couple weeks I've found myself really tired. It's hard for me to motivate myself to exercise and I'm spending more time in bed napping. I think that my hormone levels are really low because my dosage is really low. Did anyone else experience this on a starting dose? And if so, did their energy levels go back up once they were on a bigger dose? My appointment to raise my dose is in 2 days. I want to tell my nurse that I feel great because I want her to give me a higher dose. And that's mostly true, I just don't like being tired all the time, and... I'm really frustrated waiting for changes to take place. I know that I have to wait longer, I understand what the effects timelines look like, but actually waiting is agonizing. I was planning not to come out until I had been on hormones for a while, but I got forced out in July while still on the wait list at my clinic. Coming out ended up going better than I expected, but it also means that I don't have the HRT lead time that I wanted. I know that I'm a woman with all my heart but I can't help but feel some of the creeping 'imposter syndrome' and its a little draining.

But for the first time in my life, I'm on my way there. Sorry for the wall of text. So I've been a fatty fatty boombalatty for my entire adult life. Lots of cognitive dissonance and ignorance towards health caused my situation. At the start of this year, I was 285 lbs as a 5""10 27 yo male. 3 months ago I decided enough was enough. So I did something about it, I did my research and came to realise that **WEIGHT LOSS IS EASY**. It's so simple, I was wondering why I ever convinced myself otherwise. ** Calories in vs calories out**. That's it. No fads, no pills and believe it or not; no exercise required. ( definitely recommended though. Diet is for weight loss; exercise is for health). I did my calculations, I saw what my daily calorie expenditure was and I started eating under that magic number every day. I quit drinking and started being a little bit more active. Wouldn't you know it, after 1 week of this I lose almost 4 pounds. Fucking magic right? I think where most people fail is by seeing this as a *diet*. Diet implies a temporary change to allow you to go back to your original lifestyle - **this is why diets fail**. Your lifestyle needs to change **forever**. Another fairly common assumption is that you can no longer enjoy the foods you currently enjoy and you have to eat nothing but 'healthy foods'. ** This is total and complete bullshit**. My diet has not change all that much, I just eat less. Now saying all of that, you do want to add more balance to your diet. So definitely eat more fruit and vegetables - but don't think you need to have a dinner which consists of a plate of lettuce. That's just silly. You know what my favourite dinner is? A nice juicy porter house steak with a side of pasta salad and salad/veges. For me that's around a <PHONE> calorie meal and christ is it tasty. Once you get your food intake undercontroll, you'd be surprised at how this affects your life. A better diet means better sleep which means better energy, which actually makes you **want** to exercise. Crazy right? As I said, it's been 3 months and I've lost 33 pounds. If I can do it, you can do it. Don't be like me and make excuses. You know what you're doing is unhealthy and you're never going to change unless you do the work. Please also check out /r/fitness, /r/progresspics and /r/loseit. These subreddits are **fucking incredible**, who says the internet has to be a support-less and judgmental hellhole.

I think a part of me died about six years ago. I could not tell you what happened in January 2009 that caused me to start hearing what I thought were voices in my head. I do remember the hours I would spend obsessing over what these voices said to me. I do remember the pain I felt when I butchered one of my ritualistic phrases and said that I ""worship the devil"" on accident. I do remember how I begged God and pleaded for Him to have mercy on my soul. The only thing I wanted was my sanity. --------
The voices did not stop. After awhile, the hope that was alive inside my body died. There was no place for me to confide. My parents emotionally abandoned me as a child. I always knew they were there for me when I needed to be controlled. If I ever forgot the rules, I knew they would remind me. As far as dealing with the wounds that life gave me, I was on my own. I stood alone. I stood in silence. I stood as a seventeen year-old boy who thought he was schizophrenic. I knew those voices were after me. I knew those demons were trying to kill my soul. I started waking up in the middle of the night because I needed to complete my rituals; I needed to defend myself from those voices. There were nights when I would toss and turn in my bed, begging for peace. I felt as if my soul was on fire. I was screaming through the flames and there was no one there to rescue me. There was no place for me to run. There was no way to escape my mind. ------
There was also no one for me to confess. There was no comfort for me. Here I was, left in this wilderness alone. I knew time was coming to an end, soon. I believed Jesus was coming back soon. It could be any day now. I did not understand why I had to lose my sanity and my salvation, this close to the end of the world. I tried to do everything right: follow all of the rules, go to Sunday school, love my neighbor, all of the Christian mannerisms. I did not know why God was mad at me, but I knew He was done with me. I accepted this as my hell bound fate and continued to wander the wilderness. --------
After four years of hiding in shame and suffering, I finally came out and told one of my close friends I thought I was schizophrenic. He encouraged me to go to the school counseling office at my university. I learned a significant amount about my past during that time, however, I did not admit the ""voices"" I was hearing. After I started to lose my sanity more and my symptoms became harder to hide, I decided to see a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Depression. ---------
When most people think of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, they often depict the man who cannot leave his house until he touches his doorknob three times. Some of my most common obsessions include contamination, doubting, and checking. The following are examples of my thoughts: ""I left the door unlocked and someone is going to break into my house and steal my valuables. Did I turn the iron off?

I hope this person burns in Hell"" I could list many other disturbing thoughts, but I am often ashamed to admit these thoughts. Initially, I thought these were the demonic voices I was hearing. These violent, twisted thoughts were extremely contradictory to my normal thought pattern. I knew the thoughts could not belong to me. As I began to learn about OCD, I knew it was the disease that plagued my life. My OCD began with scrupulosity and has manifested into many forms of OCD. No one understands OCD's toll on life quality: all I wanted was peace, however, reality became hell. I feel damned. ---------

I have stopped hoping for my prayers to be answered. I stopped asking God to heal me from this disease. I stopped asking God to take me back. I was forced to grow up in this wilderness.

*5:15pm*
As much as I thought I had to, I wasnt ready to go into the village just yet. There were things I needed to do back in the lab. Annie and Jared obviously arent healthy and Im worried about how safe they are around one another. I remembered GeneMedica had supplied us with three bottles of Laphroaig 30 to use in celebration if we had any breakthroughs. So, I did what any self-respecting scientist would do: got my fellow researchers blackout drunk and locked them in their respective rooms with a fresh bottle to call their own. Then I called Rakesh. He seemed more freaked out than I was. Hed known Jared for 20 years; apparently hes in a 25+ year monogamous relationship with his partner, and, to directly quote Rakesh, gayer than gayer than gay. Rakesh agreed with me that stranger things have happened than two people pairing off when stuck in a bad situation, but with everything else going on - the spore eruption, the skin lesions, the pain/pleasure rewiring, and whatever the hell was happening to the villagers - it was impossible to say it was just a situational fling. He commended me for figuring out how to keep Jared and Annie safe, then he told me to get my ass into the village and take notes. I have a sinking feeling its going to be really, really ugly. *Update @ 8:00pm*
Its hard to form a coherent narrative when youve been traumatized. At the same time, its easy to recall the details of that which traumatized you. The first things I noticed, upon leaving the lab and starting the 100-or-so yard walk to the village, were the bird feathers. They were raining from the trees and blowing in the weak wind. I couldnt make out much through the thick canopy, but I could see one bird very clearly. It was perched on a branch nearest the trunk and vigorously rubbing its body against the bark. Once one side was denuded of feathers, it started on the other until the same result was achieved. Then it leapt from the branch and flew in a bizarre, insect-like trajectory that didnt seem to be going anywhere in particular. It went out of sight before I could learn what was happening to it. A dog ran out from the general direction of the village and stopped in front of me. Its fur was mangy and the visible flesh was punctured or rotted away. Its tail wagged furiously and its ears were up, making it look incredibly happy despite the painful-looking condition of its skin. I reached out to pat its head, and it obliged, pushing its snout and head against my palm very hard; almost as if itd never felt the touch of a person before. It ground its skull against my hand and I felt something slide. I recoiled and pulled back. The skin stuck to my gloved hand as I pulled, tearing the fur and flesh from its head. The dog, with blood trickling down its face and its tail still wagging, stared at me and began to eat itself off my glove. I didnt shoo it away. I didnt know what to do at all, aside from continuing my walk to the circle of huts. With each step, the details of the natives, who still swarmed in the center of their village, became apparent. I can only describe their activity as an orgy. Every conceivable pairing was demonstrated, all the way up groups as large of six. Most sickening to me, aside from the atrocious and seemingly-indiscriminate disparities in the ages of the participants, were the injuries. Every person had terrible damage to their skin. It appeared to be the same as what Annie and Jared are dealing with, but most of the villagers were much worse off; likely due to their constant and frenetic activity with one another. They paid me no attention as I walked through their midst. Every so often, Id come across a corpse. Each had profoundly-disfiguring damage to them. While I know some of it was the result the fungal spores effect, a good portion was clearly from the action of another person. This was verified when I saw a young man in the crowd, a rictus of pleasure etched across his face, having his entire back flayed open by his partner. The man gasped with clear delight, his nudity making obvious the arousal he felt despite the terrible injury. His partner pressed his face into the wound and planted tender kissed on the exposed ribs. There were more acts like that, but theyve all blurred together. Im exhausted and overwhelmed. I called Rakesh once I got back and while he expressed eympathy for what I saw, he insisted on the importance of documenting the behavior and progress of those affected by the spore cloud. I promised him Id do a better job tomorrow if I was able to get any sleep tonight. I checked on Annie and Jared; both were snoring. Their skin looked worse, though. Im not sure what to do. Rakesh assured me that by tomorrow evening theyll be able to get a helicopter to us. When I asked about where itd land, he told me not to worry about it. So Ill do my best. Im going to get drunk and try to fall asleep. **March 13th, 2015**
*6:15am*
Before I went to sleep last night, I bound Jared and Annie to their beds. It was something Rakesh suggested and I eventually decided it would be for the best. I could deal with them being pissed at me as long as they didnt hurt themselves while we waited for the helicopter. Apparently ours would be the first of a few; theres a medical helicopter scheduled to come in minutes after were taken out. While Im really happy the villagers will get medical attention, it absolutely sucks so many of them will be either dead or terribly disfigured. If wed been able to figure out the workings of that massive underground fungus, we might have been able to prevent this from happening. Im heading down to the village again. Im bringing my voice recorder so I can document enough detail to make Rakesh happy. Im not going to transcribe it all, but Ill put what I feel are the most important parts in this journal. *Update @ 12:00pm*
What I saw yesterday was paradise when compared to the devastation and depravity I was forced to observe today. Rakesh, I wish you hadnt asked me to do this. I understand why you needed me to, but Im not the same person I was a few days ago as a result. Theres just nothing I can express other than sadness and terror. Well, maybe one thing. Theres a tiny, tiny bit of solace in the fact those affected by the spores dont appear to be in pain. But the other side of that is how they gleefully destroyed their fellow villagers. People who were entirely innocent. People who, even as I write this, continue to scream with impossible ecstasy as theyre torn apart. So Rakesh, you asked for details, so here. Choke on them. * Woman, woman, man grouping. Severe skin deterioration among all three. Severe mutilation of the mans genitals. All that appears to remain is approximately 5 inches of his urethra, which is being stretched and pulled by both women. Each woman takes turns performing oral sex on the remains of the mans genitals. The smaller woman, when not occupied with the man, had created holes in the larger womans thighs, into which she thrusts her fingers and tongue. All participants in these acts express joy. * Man, boy grouping. The dead man is on his back in the dirt while the boy sits in the gashed crater of the mans belly. The boy is laughing and pulling out loops of the mans intestines. Every so often, the boy will duck his head into the dead mans stomach cavity and move around, as if trying to swim. He then erupts upward, reminding me of a dolphin leaping out of the water, before settling back down in the belly of the dead man to repeat the process. Large bite marks are visible on the boys arms. * Man, man, man, man, man grouping. Four men are having intercourse with gaping wounds in the torso of the fifth man. The fifth man is on his back on a small table, chewing on what appears to be the dismembered hand of a child. The child from whom he got the hand is not in sight. * Woman, woman grouping. The women are engaged in mutual oral sex. Each womans belly has been torn out and is dangling her viscera either onto the dirt or onto her partners body. The woman closest to me is bleeding very badly and will not live much longer. Side note: As these observations were made, I noticed a change in the surface of the spore victims skin. Aside from the growing blight of sores, the skin appears to be growing sticky. It also appears to be weakening. I watched a boy, whose back was relatively free from deterioration, get pushed back against a hut. When the boy moved forward, the skin stuck to the hut and tore from his body with each step. This is similar to what I experienced yesterday with the dogs head. * Man, man, woman grouping. The older woman is flaying all skin from the other two group participants. Both the flayed man and younger woman are sitting, apparently chatting happily, while the older woman removes their skin with a small knife. The scraps of flesh are being thrown both at the other groups of villagers and into the forest. This flesh is particularly tacky and is sticking like glue to whatever it strikes. * Woman, man, woman, woman, infant grouping. The woman on the ground appears to be in the process of giving birth to what may have been a healthy, unaffected infant. The man and other two women are pushing the infant in and out of the mother with a great deal of force. I have no doubt the infant is no longer alive. All four living participants are either laughing or yelling with excitement or pleasure. It was that sight which forced me back to the lab. Id reached my limit. When I walked in, Annie and Jared had escaped from their rooms. Once their flesh had deteriorated, it was not difficult for them to slip out of their bindings. I hadnt bothered to lock their bedroom doors after tying them up. They had resumed their intercourse from the day before. Jared was atop Annie, chest to chest. When I entered the lab, Jared, surprised and delighted to see me, lifted himself off Annie. Their skin clung together and the force of his motion tore the flesh from the muscles. Amused by this, Annie pulled back from Jared and attempted to disengage their genitals. Her vaginal walls clung to Jareds penis as she moved, sloughing off and separating from her anatomy. They stood in front of me, like they did yesterday, happy to talk about how much fun they were having. I couldnt stand to look at them. I asked if theyd kindly go back to their rooms and wait for a little while. Even though they looked confused, they listened to me. I locked them in. Thats when I began to write this entry. As I type, I can hear them moaning as they pleasure themselves. I dont know what Im going to do between now and the eight hours before the helicopter is supposed to arrive, but Im compelled to go into the forest and see if I can salvage anything useful from this horror show. Even if I dont see anything, maybe it can help clear my head. *Update @ 6:00pm*
The first important thing I noticed was how the chunks of flesh thrown by woman who flayed her two partners had sprouted mushrooms. Small, stringy mushrooms. Everywhere I found chunks of flesh, I found the mushrooms. Also of note: the orgy of hideousness in the village had abruptly stopped. I hurried back to see what had happened. I thought at first they might all be dead, but they were standing there, smiling and wandering around aimlessly. Their injuries were horrific; some catastrophic. Those too hurt to move lay on the ground. The sticky flesh that had touched the dirt had begun to grow the same mushrooms. Gradually, those capable of walking started to spread out in all directions. They moved slowly, picking their skin and throwing it on the ground as they walked. Over time, they increased their speed. I ran behind a group of boys. They pulled small strips of skin from their bodies and flung it to the dirt with each step. The bit off their own lips and tongues and spit them on the ground or at the trees. They ran and ran and ran, leaving a trail of gore behind them. I looked from side to side and saw the other villagers running and tearing themselves to shreds as they went. I must have gone a few miles before I couldnt continue. The hazmat suit was too heavy and I was overheated and exhausted. I turned around and trudged back. The closer I got to town, the first few scraps of flesh that had been torn off had already started sprouting the same stringy mushrooms. I was overwhelmed with visceral disgust and scientific intrigue. Back in the village, no one was left alive. Whoever was capable of running away had done so, and all the corpses remained where theyd fallen or been dropped. Each of the carcasses were sprouting bouquets of fungus. Out of nowhere, I remembered Annie and Jared. I ran back to the lab, threw open their doors, and saw the consequences of being too late to help them. Both were dead. Theyd torn themselves to shreds and blanketed the bedrooms with their flesh and blood. With no dirt or plant life for the mushrooms to grow on, the flesh just sat there. I dont know why I did what I did next, but at the time, it felt like the only way to honor them. I scooped up what I could of their remains and threw it on the ground by the lab. I sat and watched as the mushrooms grew. Now Im waiting for the helicopter. ---
Thats the end of the journal. The helicopter picked me up around 10pm. The other teams came in later to do whatever investigations needed to be done. Physically, I was fine. Aside from stewing in a sweaty hazmat suit for two days with a terrible cold and too few fluids, my body was no worse for wear. The bodies of the villagers were found over the course of the next few weeks. Some of them had made it almost 45 miles before their bodies gave out and they dropped. All that could be recovered were bones. Its almost a year later and Im back in the area with a new team. Having to wear a hazmat suit at all times when were not in the lab sucks, but no one wants to go through what happened to our colleagues. The research difficulties wed faced for the last ten years still plague us, but at least a few questions about the fungus have been answered. Still, when its quiet or Im working alone, I think about the villagers blindly running as far as their bodies would go, all while tearing themselves apart just so theyd fertilize the ground with the spores of that which had possessed them. And I cant stop thinking about how, because of it, a full five miles have been added to the radius of where that particular mushroom grows.

*""Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop*
*When the wind blows, the cradle will rock*
*When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall*
*And down will come baby, cradle and all . . .""* I must have sung that one a thousand times, Margery joining in with no small amount of gusto. That was my first task. Put precious Jaime to bed. And Jaime loves nursery rhymes, so I was forced to sing to him as I rocked him in my arms and Margery danced to the tune, eyes closed, arms whirling. Lionel and Bosworth were nowhere to be found. Dylan took it all without so much as a minuscule shift in his expression. I studied his face as I held him, trying to gage his thoughts, trying to peer into his state of mind and wordlessly ask him about the horrors he had endured in the last decade. There was nothing. I had prayed to see anger in those brown depths, hatred toward his captors maybe, embers of resolve but it was as if all the fight had gone out of him. He seemed . . . My heart clenched. Eventually, Dylans eyes began to droop and he nestled into my chest as though he were a real baby. For the briefest of moments I thought I could feel him squeeze my arms quickly a sign of recognition or a plea for help. But my fleeting hope disappeared once I realized he had actually fallen asleep. Hed been a chubby kid, but there was so little of him now that I knew I wouldnt need help lifting him. He was so malnourished that I barely struggled to carry him to his crib. It was marginally bigger than a regular one and my heart broke at the thought of him lying here for years, the implications for not only his physical health but his psyche as well. This was humiliating. What were they playing at? Forcing a grown man to pretend to be a baby? After I put him down, I felt Margerys claw-like hand clasp my shoulder. He is so precious, my little boy. I can see that youve grown attached to him already. There is a bond. Her overly-animated voice chirped in my ear, her mouth so close to my face I could smell something rancid on her breath. She giggled in that creepy way of hers, a sound that bore no trace of happiness or joy, but rather seemed to slowly scrape away at my sanity. Like nails on a chalkboard. You have been the only nanny so far who has been so helpful. She placed her chin on my neck, its boniness digging into my skin. Revulsion washed over me in waves and I had to force myself not to shake off her grip. You are the only one that seems to connect with our little Jaime. The others were all so . . . Here she sighed dramatically, her impossibly wide grin tilting downwards. She giggled again, squeezing my shoulder. But youre a good little girlie, arent you? Youre not going to disappoint us like they did. You are going to stay with us, become part of our family. Were so excited to have you here. I could hear the blood pound in my ears. What . . . what happened to the other nannies? I asked quietly. Margerys smile grew even wider, more malicious. Oh, we had to let them go. But theyre safe, theyre sorry, theyre so, so beautiful now. She pinched my cheek. Lovely rose of a young woman, you are. Then she practically leaped away from me and began chanting Ring-Around-The-Rosie, winking at me before skipping out of the nursery. Only once she left did I release the breath Id been holding. I had to stay sane, strong. I couldnt fall apart. I couldnt cry. I couldnt freak out. I needed to keep my head if I was going to get us both out of here. I was offered a guest bedroom but told them Id rather sleep in the babys room, in case he woke in the middle of the night or something. Margery assured me that Jaime never did that, he was not one of those naughty toddlers. I spent the entire day scoping out the room, looking for hidden cameras as subtly as I could. I found two, one hidden between the knickknacks of a shelf and the other in the button of a teddy bear. I pretended to check on him as he slept, but I was actually poking at Dylan, trying to wake him. I wasnt sure how I was going to get rid of the cameras without them noticing, but I couldnt wait until Id come up with a good enough idea to talk to him. He was practically comatose. He didnt budge, not an inch, not even when I pinched him so hard his skin bruised. It was almost as if theyd drugged him. I was invited to have supper with them a few hours later. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to endure, sitting opposite them, watching them eat and carry on as though they had not destroyed the life of my best friend. I thought of his parents, how heartbroken they were when their sons case was closed. A lump formed in my throat. I couldnt be sentimental. I couldnt be weak, not if I wanted to survive. If I wanted to get out of this, I had to be calm and I had to be clever. I dragged my fork through the mashed potato on my plate, not intending to eat anything these monsters were serving me. I didnt drink anything, either. I went to the bathroom or kitchen and drank water from the tap if I got thirsty. I cleared my throat politely. Margery stopped her singing and looked at me expectantly, food crested around her mouth which still hung open mid-song. That damn woman could never stop singing. Um, I had a thought. She smiled encouragingly at me. I continued. If I am going to take on this job, you expect me to be here full-time, right? She nodded slowly, her head lolling to the side. Lionel remained quiet, polishing off the steak on his plate. Bosworth, whod been lurking in the corner of the room, looked as nervous as ever. I took a deep breath. Well, thats not going to work. I mean, you took my phone, right? If I just stay here and skip all of my classes and not let anyone know that Im ok, then theyre going to worry and call the police. Theyll look for me, thinking Im unsafe or being hurt and if they find me here, which they will, then they
Margery suddenly let out a loud, inhuman-sounding screech, covering both of her ears as she shook her head violently. The sudden display chased my planned speech right back down my throat and I nearly pissed my pants right then and there. Then suddenly, she stopped. Just like that, as though she could turn off her craziness with a switch. She smiled at me, spittle glistening on the sides of her mouth, dripping down her chin. She cocked her head to the side again. Youre not planning on disappointing us, are you? Her voice had returned to its normal, chirpy cadence as she singsong-ed the words, but there was a very evident threat beneath the sugar. I shook my head no. No, no, of course not. I want to be here. I want to be part of this family. That seemed to steady her mood. She straightened her head. I was learning the outlines of their insanity, learning where to tread and where to sidestep. All I was trying to say was that I should let at least one person know that Im safe. If I could call someone, they would make sure that no one informs the police or gets the wrong idea. For what must have been a full minute she said nothing, just stared at me, smiling. I never thought a smile could make me feel as sickened as I did then. But there was something worse than Margery Fitzwillys smile. Finally, finally, she answered. I suppose that makes sense, dear. Though, you must understand, weve had so many girls and boys who said they wanted to be a part of our family too. They disappointed us. They tried to get away from us, tried to get us in trouble. I like you, girl. I really, really do. I would hate for you to be just another disappointment. She flattened her veined, weathered hands on the table. But I do see your point. We shall need to trust you first. Trust must be earned. Then she stood, as did Lionel. They both left without another word to me. Bosworth escorted me to the nursery. Dylan was still asleep. I tried talking to Bosworth but he simply shut me in the nursery and bolted the door from the outside. I sank into the rocking chair beside the crib and just sat there for what felt like hours, stewing over what I could possibly do to earn their trust. Only once the idea began to form in my mind, did I allow myself the luxury of falling asleep. The next morning brought a fresh sense of determination. When I woke up, Dylan was on his knees and leaning against the bars of his crib, looking at me. I couldnt say anything to him just yet. I knew we were being watched and listened to. So I got him out and dressed him in day clothes. I could hear his hollow stomach rumbling, so I carried him downstairs. The door had been unlocked in the early hours. I had to put him in a giant high-chair and then feed him a bottle of formula. Something made me feel vaguely uneasy about the white liquid, but he drank it greedily, and I made a mental note to try and replace it with something else. Margery made me play with him, flying toys through the air and making all the sound effects as well. I tried moving through the house under the guise of our little games, trying to spot my phone, but of course it was never in plain sight. Dylan remained as quiet as death, but still tried to grab the toys I teased him with, acting out the role so faithfully I wondered if he had started to lose his real identity through the years. Nothing overtly strange happened until about mid-afternoon. I had taken a bathroom break and when I came back, Margery was waiting for me outside. She tilted her head to the side in her regular, creepy fashion, and pointed to where Dylan lay sniffling. The baby needs changing. My stomach dropped. No, they werent going to make me do this. Yes, they were. I was forced to change Dylans diaper. Hed shit himself quit badly, and there was something different about his demeanour, a fracture in his previous monotony. I was more concerned about the humiliation this guy must have felt than having to clean up his shit. This was the regular pattern of events for about a week. I fed him, burped him, changed him, played with him, sang to him, put him to sleep. The initial bubble of hysterical laughter that had accompanied nearly every routine had long since vanished by the third day of this. I was getting angrier, wearier, more pissed off. I had to try and gain their trust by making them think I was being compliant but I didnt know how much more of this I could take. I still couldnt communicate with Dylan safely, for someone was always watching us. I eventually memorised the layout of the bottom floor as I was never allowed up the stairs. But I knew the living areas and kitchen and library and nursery quite well, even discovered a crawlspace hidden in the back of the nursery, though it lay in one of the cameras line of vision. The day eventually came when Margery allowed me my phone call, after I managed to convince her that people would definitely be starting to worry now. I had put Dylan down for his nap. It was late afternoon, early evening. I was called into the kitchen and handed my phone, the Fitzwillys and Bosworth facing me, waiting to listen to make sure I didnt say anything I shouldnt. Lionel leaned over my shoulder, watching me select the number. I couldnt call the police. The only person who was in my city right now, who Id known for a long time and who might believe the insanity of my situation was Zander. So I clicked on his contact. Lionel nodded. Zander, to my eternal shock and everlasting gratitude, actually picked up on the forth ring. his voice was distorted and there was a ton of noise in the background. He was obviously busy, at some event or other. Yeah, um, hi. My voice was surprisingly even. I shifted my gaze to take in all of the three people around me. Lionel still waited behind me, Margery stood to my left and Bosworth to my right. The counter stood in front of me. From the sound of his voice, I was probably the last person on this planet Zander would ever imagine calling him. I could practically hear him raising his eyebrows. Uh, how have you been? Im good, Ive been good, thanks. Look, Teresa, not that Im being an asshole or anything, but why are you calling me? I cant say hi to an old friend? I laughed the fakest laugh I had ever emitted in my life. Youre hilarious. Okay, Im gonna need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? Teresa, whats going
I shoved Lionel as hard as I could, careful to not end the call. I dove over the counter and felt Margery grab onto my foot. I lifted my other leg and kicked her hard in the face. She fell back with a scream and I ran like hell to the nursery. I grabbed the key from the outside lock, shut the doors and bolted it. Dylan was still asleep, still put out by whatever shit they put in his formula before every nap and sleep session. I put the phone to my ear, heart beating out of control. Zander was still in mid-sentence. iously, what the fuck is going on over there? The background noise had faded to a murmur. He must have gone somewhere quieter. His voice was angry but there was concern as well. I could already hear Margerys banshee-like screams, I could hear the thundering of footsteps down the hall. Listen, please! Im with Dylan right now and were in a trouble. You need to get the cops to come over here and now! The people were with might kill us! Bosworths heavy blows began shaking the door. I moved to take Dylan out of the crib and hide him, just in case theyd try to hurt him. Zander, please, youre the only one who can help us. What, did you just say 'Dylan'? I dont
I SWEAR TO GOD THIS ISN'T A JOKE! PLEASE JUST GET HELP! I screamed out the address at him several times before my phone died. I rushed around the room looking for the cameras, then covered them. I turned off the light and began dragging Dylan to the crawlspace Id mapped out in my head. We had just reached it when the door came flying off its hinges. I quickly laid Dylan inside as comfortably as I could in my haste and left the door semi-open, moving a chair in front of it. The light came on and then Bosworth was picking me up by the arms. I kicked out, as hard as I could, catching him once in the groin and he barely flinched. That was . . . not normal. He threw me to the floor and when I looked up, I looked up into the most horrific sight I had ever seen in my life. I thought Margery Fitzwillys smiles were unsettling. But they was nothing compared to the long, long frown she wore that dipped past her sagging jowls. Her face was bloody from the kick my boot had delivered, thick blood pouring out of her nose. Her eyes had gone dark, something vicious and evil barely restrained behind them. Lionel wasnt there. Just Margery, in her terrifying glory. She leaned down until her bleeding nose nearly touched mine. Naughty, naughty girl. Why did you do that? She tilted her head to the side, several degrees further than what looked comfortable or natural. I felt a dread unlike any other I had ever experienced before begin to seep into my very soul. Take her. She straightened herself and Bosworth picked me up again, dragging me by the arms out of the nursery. She sang as I was carried screaming across the floors of the house and down a flight of stairs, her voice the same eerie chirrup that only fed my terror and panic. *Ring-a-round the rosie,*

And I don't think I started feeling better until I finally felt like I could tell them everything and that was a couple months in. It's not even telling them everything, it's having them be able to communicate that they see that you feel stuck. The first thing is that you have to take the view that as long as you are trying and putting all the effort you can into your job hunt, addressing your issues, etc......that you aren't a failure. Failure is when you quit, and I myself quit many things because of the depression. Sounds easy when you write it out, it's TREMENDOUSLY hard. The therapist will probably tell you to keep a regular schedule, take a shower and change into clothes you would leave the house in...so you at least did that ""normal"" thing. Eat regularly even if you aren't hungry. Don't drink alcohol. Take your medications, especially if you are on anti-depressants...but even your blood pressure/blood sugar can make your mood worse. Also thyroid issues can cause depression, so if you have the potential for that you need to get it checked. Personally I found talking to people to help, outside of therapy. Lack of contact really makes you feel worthless on top of everything else. Doesnt even necessarily have to be about the depression itself, just express the ""loop""/""trap"" you are in and see if they can see the best path forward or at least they say ""Well you're doing everything you can, see your therapist, etc"". I personally don't think people can truly comprehend the self-hatred that comes with that deep depression unless they've had it. And people pick up on it, I am 100% sure it bleeds through on job interviews especially if you really don't want that position as much as they'd like you to pretend you do. So, I say therapy, express what you've said here. Get a therapist you like, if you don't like the first one you meet go to another. If you don't want to talk to a man about it, get a woman, old vs young, etc. Apply to interviews and go, just try to picture the best possible outcome.

s_1715_78,Find evidence for special case in this post,"I wrote an essay on the subject as I have suffered from is for many years:
Intro: I wrote this essay for my AP Language class. We had to pick a word and explain its meaning and how it has changed and what it means to you. A big part of this assignment was having a voice. I hope you enjoy. For those curious I got a 90%. Essay: Over expression is the destruction of all language. When strict phrases lose their meaning there can no longer be words that fit the deep emotions and situations that occur in a lifetime. A word that means a lot to me is depression. I was diagnosed with depression at an early age and it isnt something I am particularly proud of. When I told friends and family that I had depression the questions that came up often were Why cant you just be happy? and Whats wrong? These questions are invalid when talking about the true kind of depression that exists. Over the years by over use and twisting, this deep and meaningful word has lost the one thing it exemplifies. As I struggle through life one thing that has always hurt me deeply is that the word depression is used liberally. Oh man I have so much homework this is depressing. I cant go out to see my friends tonight I am depressed. The way depression is used in these sentences is not how the word should be utilized. Depression is a serious medical issue plaguing significant populations throughout the world. Depression isn't feeling sad like it is portrayed today. Depression could be seen as the black of emotions - it is not one emotion; it is the lack of emotions like how black is the absence of color. It is almost impossible to describe what exactly being depressed entails. When I become depressed I do not cry, I do not weep, I become someone I am not. I become an unmovable object. It is hard to feel anything when in a depressed state. All that I am able to register when I am depressed is a mild ache. I dont want to do anything, nothing productive, and certainly nothing for leisure. Staring off into the distance becomes the most attractive notion. Activities that I usually find fun lose their touch and with them I lose touch with reality. The episodes aren't triggered by situations, I can be having the time of my life but all of a sudden I just lose the entertainment value from what I am doing and fall into a pit of seeming despair. When asked why I feel depressed I can only answer, I dont know. A lot of people get angry when a person is depressed like it is their fault and they are just being babies. This is not so; It has been shown to be genetic - traveling through family lines like the plague. I got it from my dad and he got it from his dad. I am not an isolated case. Many of my friends have gotten their depression from their parents or family members. The only bonus of this is that people with depression can relate to others and arent alone. As much as this is a bonus it is also a drawback. As people see so many cases hatred for the condition becomes wide spread they begin to see it as an act as someone being attention seeking. This could not be farther from the truth. For the few that fake symptoms as a gig for attention there is an army of people pleading in the shadows afraid to seek help because they believe their friends and family will shun them. Why has this problem gotten so out of hand? It is because of the use of the word in todays society. People have gotten sick of saying I feel sad this seems like baby talk to them. They want something sophisticated and mature so they go to the next step adding a deeper emotion. The scapegoat for this craving has become depression. An emotional rollercoaster that today seems to be cursed by having a word assigned to it. Since people say they are depressed all the time the ones with the serious cases are overlooked, they are seen as people just being sad. As time progresses and ignorance runs wild people like me can end up committing an act that cannot be reversed- suicide. Death is the final solution and how someone can be pushed so far to do it is unthinkable and is truly deserving of remorse. Sadly - extremely and utterly merciful is the fact that even death from depression has lost its meaning. I walk through school after a suicide case has been in the news and hear the unthinkable. I have been depressed before. This person just wanted attention by committing suicide. We should not publicize him or her, it is probably exactly what he or she wanted. I hear the same thing in a hundred different ways. It just blows my mind. How can a human life be valued so little? It can all be traced back to this word becoming a daily occurrence. Overtime everyone has begun to believe they have experienced depression because at one point or another they have been unhappy. I, defending someones life and legacy have argued directly with these people asking them how they can say such horrible things about a tragic death. They just say the same thing over and over again. I have experienced depression, so what I say is true. Going back to the first quotes in my literature I see what they believe is depression. A slight inconvenience, a days work, and anything that makes them go out of their way makes them their version of depressed. This is not how the word is supposed to be used. Adults and kids alike die everyday from being depressed. This is not because they are attention seeking and it is not because they are simply gloomy. One of the main reasons is because they dont know where they fit anymore. As the one word to describe this extreme emotion loses its meaning the people with the condition no longer feel like they fit anywhere. They begin to feel different, like they are the only person in the world who has these episodes. Along with feeling different they feel hopeless and truly useless. A species like ours that has such a capacity for compassion could save so many lives by just being thoughtful. No one has the right to make someone feel isolated. Unknowingly this is what is happening as the word depression loses its meaning. People with this serious medical condition are starting to feel isolated from the whole. Depressed people are not different from anyone else, they are not attention seekers and they are not over exaggerating. People need to comprehend that using over complicated diction that they dont understand is not how you sound smart. Someone sounds smart by using accurate word choice as to not run the line of changing a word for the worse.","When I become depressed I do not cry, I do not weep, I become someone I am not.",1667,9,1

s_835_14,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Unexplained Incident in New Haven Greetings everyone. My name is Dwayne. I'm a state trooper out of New Haven Connecticut. I've been on the force for almost 20 years and a few months back something strange happened that I've not been able to shake. I've always been a bit of a drinker but ever since that night things have been bad. I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day. I'm hoping that maybe sharing this with someone will help. I can only imagine what my ex would say, so I'm turning towards the anonymous internet instead. It was a fair day and I was cruising down 95 heading back to the station when I got the call. ""Young woman causing a scene crossing interstate 95."" This was the entirety of the report. I called in to get the mile marker and found that I was relatively close. I had been in a hurry to get off of work that day to see my daughter, but frankly the idea of seeing her mother was enough to encourage my to respond. I called in that I was on my way and headed toward the reported scene. This internet age is crazy. Before I even reached the location I was watching a Youtube video of a young girl running and spinning in circles in the middle of the highway. Sammy at dispatch had texted the link partially so I would know what was happening, but mostly because Sammy was a bored busy-body who loved gossip and glamorization. Regardless, by the time I reached the scene I immediately recognized her. She was hard to miss. She was half naked, with the rags of a white camisole as her only protection against the elements. She was crouched with her shoulder pressed alongside the concrete barrier and frantically peeking over, and then ducking back down. I positioned my car to protect her from the flow of traffic and called in my position. I carefully got out of the car, and approached her a gently as I could. I had spent years dealing with domestic disputes, which more often than not, included some paranoid, drug addled husband. The state of this woman looked very familiar, and I knew not to provoke someone as high as she must have been. She saw me coming from long off and locked eyes with mine as I, step by step, got closer. I held my hands low, palms down, showing that I was not a threat. I was good at this and it worked. She let me get within speaking distance without becoming startled, though her eyes were wild and full of trepidation. ""Sweetheart, I'm here to help you."" She ignore me, instead popping her head up and looking over the barrier to the opposite side of the highway. I looked and saw nothing. ""You're in danger, young lady""
She spun her head to eyeball me intensely. she whispered forcefully. Let me help you. Get into the car and we'll leave."" I walked towards the car, looking over my shoulder to see her positioning and preparing to follow me like a cat. The moment my door was open she darted from her position and was in the back seat of my cruiser faster than I would have imagined possible. I pulled away and headed back to the station, all the while looking at her in my rear view. She was cut, bruised, scraped and clearly not well. She kept darting from one window to another looking for something. ""You're going to be ok now. Can you tell me what happened?"" ""They're coming."" She was distracted, still on the lookout. ""Did someone hurt you? Are they here?"" I slowed the car a bit in case the perp was in the local vicinity. She did not answer, yet her answer was clear. She was obviously worried about being found by the people who hurt her. I called into dispatch telling them that I had secured the girl, and that I was on my way back now. She completely flipped out. She started kicking the seat behind me, spinning her body and screaming. They'll hear! They'll find us!"" tears were streaming down her cheeks. You're safe with me. They won't be able to hurt you. Do they have a police scanner? Is that what you mean?"" I was now starting to realize that this girl might not be crazy or drugged. Her eyes were clear, and although highly disturbed, she did not seem to have the classic signs of a tweaker. ""They will hear."" She lowered her voice, looking into my eyes in the mirror. No more radio. We'll get you back to the station."" She calmed a bit and fumbled with her hands between her knees. We only had a few minutes left until we reached the station and the detectives would take over. My curiosity got the better of me and I continued to ask questions. I knew that this was perhaps my only chance to actually figure out what was happening, and frankly the idea of tracking down the scum that hurt this young girl was exciting. ""Who did this. Do you know where they are?"" ""Elsewhere. They took me. They took me long ago and.... it's different. That place. They found me, and they're looking again.... to take me back, to take me."" She was slow and despondent now. ""What does it look like, the place? ""It's... It's bad, and purple. It comes in waves but they hurt. They pull at you, tearing. And the flashes, they... they pull too... but... your brain, your eyes."" This was getting nowhere fast. I decided that I was not likely to get any legitimate information at this point and stopped. My silence was interrupted by her fresh screams. She held her temples with the palms of her hands, fingers extended, shouting ""They're here now, they found me!"" Over her deranged shouting I heard the break of my radio, and answered it. ""Car 19, this is dispatch, what's you're location?"" This was so routine as to be automatic for me. I looked out the drivers side window to check and replied instantly. ""Mile marker 36."" Then something stuck me. "" ""Sammy, that you?"". I got nothing in return. "" And then it was too silent. I looked in my rear view to nothing but an empty seat. I jammed my breaks and pulled to the breakdown lane, and ran out of the car. I checked the back thoroughly to find nothing. She was just.... gone. There was no sign she'd ever even been there. I came back to the station empty handed. I was questioned about what was going on. I told them the truth. I told them every single part of what I'm telling you. What I got in return was a 3 week leave, and to never be looked at without concern since. I still have my career, but no one on the force treats me the same. I don't treat myself the same. I learned on that day that there was something enormous and unexplained among us. I was no threat to it, probably not even a consideration compared to that. But ""that"" exists. My reality is theirs. They are here, and there is nothing I can do about it. I just pray that they never want me.","I've been irritable, out of sorts and frankly drinking through each day.",333,0,1

s_201_13,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Had a very bad break down in school today. Not even sure I can make it through the night. Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried. A counselor came in and took me to the office where my favorite teacher (guy. suffers from anxiety and depression) let me just vent, since he knows everything I have gone through with bestfriend/boyfriend person. I had to write an incident report because of what Madison did and shit. I got calmed down and when I finally started walking back to class, I saw M with bestfriend/boyfriend's beanie... I died a little and went to class with tears in my eyes, as always. After that class ended, I went to bestfriend/boyfriend- let's start calling him J- and said ""I don't think you mean to, but you're breaking my heart."" and he just looked at me and said he was sorry, and explained him and M have *nothing* going on at all, and he just held her hand for a moment to calm her down. I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not *you*. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even *really* express it to him. Two of our friends are going to talk to him about this tomorrow, because they are both quite pissed about the way he's handling this, especially after today...
I miss what I had, and I don't know why I feel so broken. I really just want to die, to be honest. It would feel a lot better than this... I'm cutting again, I've stopped taking my meds... I just... I've been suffering in silence for a month. Today, I broke that silence, but in the wrong way, and to the wrong person...

All what I do is catch myself whenever I start drifting off with them, I don't punish myself for it or even make another thought about it, I just return to my attempted stillness. It still takes me a while, maybe five to ten minutes, for that main road of thoughts to slow it's traffic. When it has quietened down however I notice and know I am on the right path; this path is often accompanied by abstract imagery and completely unrelated to one another thoughts. During my best meditations I keep this up and reach what I consider actual 'meditation'. I perceive this to be actual 'meditation' because this is the furthest I've came in the process. During this stage surreal and extraordinary things happen. During my entire meditation session I am always aware of a rising numbness in my body, I'm used to this from my attempts at astral projection and lucid dreaming. However it can (not always) reach a level in meditation where I feel lighter than air, as if someone has tied perfectly balanced balloons to different points of my body and I'm now no longer effected by gravity. The main 'effect' this 'meditation' has on me though is in my mind. There are multiple states I can enter into but they are all similar in feeling and aftereffect. The main one is where I have zero thoughts and almost feels like my consciousness has been enveloped by a bubble of quiet. The only way I can describe the feeling of it is [this shot](<URL>) in Spirited Away. That specific shot where she is in a bubble of water. It is like I am in a womb where there is no such thing as thoughts, time or worries. Another state of mind I have entered is one of complete and utter peace, I have had this experience recently and is to date the strongest and most humbling meditation experience I've had. Again there were no worries, restrictions or ego but in this experience unlike the last one I was consciously living the outcome instead of being in a bubble of thoughtlessness. It's not that this experience was better or worse than the bubble, it was just different. I cannot describe how great this feeling was, in fact I felt so good, so confident with everything, so at ease, like the world was perfect, I actual felt compelled to cease my meditation and continue on with my day as if this feeling had always been there and always would be. I was lifted into a state where the world was always perfect, good an kind. I did not think or feel any negative thoughts, or emotions or even have memories of them. I feel the lack of negative memories is what caused be to cease my meditation. I believed that that is how my day to day life was. The last state I will explain is about observing my own thoughts or my own mind (I'm not sure myself). I have experienced multiple times a feeling of observing my own mind. This comes when I've reached a point where not thinking about anything is now easy, when I've reached a stage where I am easily able to just sit and be conscious. I feel like I've slogged and dragged myself through the proverbial mud of thoughts and am now above it, free and easy to relax. I feel this state isn't as deep as the two mentioned previous but it is on it's way. Lastly, over my timing meditating I've came to the realisation that I do not need to word my thoughts for them to be thoughts, this may sound obvious but I do not mean it in the sense of remembering something or visualising imagery. I mean it in the sense that, for example, if I'm going over something in my mind, maybe trying to decide the pros and cons of something I'm wording it out in my mind; I'm internally talking to myself. I've realised that I don't need to do that, I can instead take the words out of the equation and just use my emotional consciousness to come to a conclusion. It's generally much faster as I actually know what the best outcome is already, the words are just slowing me down and allowing me to trick myself. It's almost like a mini meditation in a way because I'm putting out the thoughts and allowing my consciousness (me) to decide. After any good meditation session I 'wake up' feeling renewed, relaxed, cozy and level-headed. Because I've flushed out all negativity and nitpicking little thoughts I have no immediate worries or expectations, everything feels good. Slowly however as I remember or come across concerns of the real world, no matter how small, this feeling fades away and I am back to my regular self albeit holding onto what I have experienced and/or learnt during my meditation. Anyway, that is my experience so far summed up. I didn't include everything I've experienced but I didn't want this to be in unnecessary detail. It's also quite difficult describing these things, you really have to have your own experience. Obviously your experience will probably differ and you will have your own almost indescribable states. I didn't put a TL;DR because it is quite impossible to do that with this subject. Thank you for reading and please share your own experiences and revelations.","Because I've flushed out all negativity and nitpicking little thoughts I have no immediate worries or expectations, everything feels good.",4378,0,1
s_2415_941,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,Be nice to people. Try to date girls. These two are the things I just don't do. I have never had a girlfriend who cared about me. Few were interested for superficial reasons(my face) but no one emotionally attached to me. I have had 3-4 severe crushes and they all broke my heart before we even became friends. I mean they just refused to understand me and talk to me as if I am some dirty thing that shouldn't be around them. Fuck them man! I also try not to be as nice to people as I was. They seem to think being nice means weak. They try to take advantage of you if you're too nice. I am quite apathetic now and I don't give a fuck about anyone including myself. Now I just want a job that can make sure I survive. I don't want to live(not suicidal) and I just do not want to enjoy my life. It will be taken away and that fear stops me from loving life again. I just don't want to do anything. Just...don't want to exits. Just...survive for another 40-50 years. I am 19 if that matters.,I don't want to live(not suicidal) and I just do not want to enjoy my life.,719,8,1

s_2015_23,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Me [21/M] and my friend [21/F] are potentially in the midst of a fallout because of a start-up company we're helping to run. I'm depressed and struggling with suicidal thoughts, and she is furious with me for being indirect and rude to her. I don't know what to do so I thought I would come here. My best friend / roommate just lost a great deal of respect for me. We are in the midst of starting a business, for which I am the graphic designer. Since it's a start-up, none of us are getting paid for any of the work that we do, yet I have been spending two-three hours daily working on designs for the company. I put all of my personal art/design projects on hold and my grades have been starting to suffer. She hasn't been the most understanding, using ""this is a business, sometimes things aren't fair"" as a reason to drastically shorten due dates for big projects last minute and telling clients that I will do free work for them, as well, without my consent. Regardless, I did not feel very respected, and tried to bring this up, but she reacted negatively every time I did. Being terrified of direct conflict, I internalized all of the negativity I had built up, acting very passive aggressively with her and sometimes ignoring her when she would try to talk to me about projects. This went on for a couple of days until I asked to talk with her earlier this evening. I tried to express my issues with her but she (being a very forward extrovert) conveyed the problems she had with me much more easily. She told me that she didn't deserve the way I have been treating her and that it was childish and that I should have been more direct. I recognized all of this and quietly apologized; I also choked and was pretty silent for most of the conversation. In any case, I plan on leaving the company and trying to fix the mess I have made of my academic semester. The problem is that although we are terrible doing business together, we live together so well and get along amazingly. Before this, we didn't have any problems with one another. It feels really awful to be afraid to talk to the person I consider my best friend, and I hate myself for having hurt her. I've been dealing with depression for a bit over a year now, and this has definitely triggered a lot for me. I feel like a failure as a friend for not being able to effectively talk about my problems, instead acting extremely rude without explanation. I am very severely shaming myself for having hurt a person that I care about, and I have self-harmed and had suicidal thoughts for the first time in a while. If I am failing my classes, have tarnished my living situation and closest friendship, and can't keep a start-up going for less than half a year, then why am I even bothering anymore?","I'm depressed and struggling with suicidal thoughts, and she is furious with me for being indirect and rude to her.",125,8,1

s_2953_756,Find evidence for special case in this post,"OP Found girlfriend's ovulation tests Mood spoiler: gt;!Sad but hopeful for the future! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/fkcorona](<URL>) **Found ovulation tests but we don't plan on having kids and have protected sex. Is she cheating?** So a week ago I opened our closet and noticed that the box where we keep our sex toys looked different. I looked inside and noticed there were 3 things missing. Asked my girlfriend about it, she said she didn't know anything about it somewhat later she then said she took them out and put them somewhere else. When I asked her where she said she forgot where and she would search for them. When I asked her again yesterday, she got angry and said she had no time for looking and was dodging questions. Today I searched for myself. Didn't find them but I found some ovulation tests. We don't plan to get kids. Is there any other reason that shes using these tests? Like medical reasons? ( She has a history with HPV) Or is she cheating? She's not at home right now and I'm getting crazy so I'm asking her before I look like an idiot when I'm asking her tonight. Not a native speaker so sorry for my english Edit. I should have mentioned that we didn't have sex for about a month now and I found these tests in her backpack she uses when shes sleeping at friends Edit 2:When I tried to talk to her calmly about the toys she got really angry fast and left the room. And about asking the friends. Half the time I don't even know at which friends house she is. When I ask her she says stuff like : some girls I met at soccer practices or at a party. Last Sunday when I asked her where she's going she misspoke the name of a friend that I know. She then told me that she always calls her that name (I never head her call her friend that so that was weird too Update: Hours ago my now ex girlfriend came home and after reading the comments on my post I felt like an paranoid idiot, so I decided to drop it. She acted really weird when she came home and I noticed that she had something in her hand when she came out of the toilet and went to our bedroom. Immediately my inner alarm went off and as soon as she left the bedroom I was looking for what she's hiding. I found a used ovulation test and another package with one pill that was missing under her pants under a pillow. I took a picture and after searching the name from the package on Google it's an emergency contraceptive called ellaone. .. [ <URL>](<URL>) I was fucking shocked and disgusted when I read that and I still am. So I immediately went to her and asked about the toys again and why there are these ovulation test under her bed. Before she could lie to me I just told her that I know that she just took that pill. She started fucking laughing, I told her that this is absolutely not funny in any way. She told me to let her alone but I was so mad that I just asked her the same fucking questions until she started crying. She accused me of hacking her phone, that I was spying on her, that I'm the bad one until she finally told me the truth. About a month ago she messaged one of her coaches on Instagram because of some sport lotion and where to get it and all that. They exchanged numbers, kept chatting and started to meet. So the sleepovers were indeed them fucking. When I asked about the toys she just said that I would know where they are and she had the tests because they fucked without protection. She now wants me to leave the apartment and told me that she already had legal advice weeks ago and that I have 1 month to leave because I'm just the subtenent. Knowing that she already planned this makes me so incredibly sick. She's gone now and I feel like I'm dead. I'm not sad or angry I just feel nothing right now. 5 years wasted for nothing. How can someone be this fucking cold I just don't understand. We moved about two years ago to a different city because she wanted to study here. I don't have friends here where I can live until I find something. I don't have a family and 1 month to find a home in one of the busiest cities in Germany. I never thought that I get cheated on. I'm not perfect but I don't think that I deserve this. She's a different person to me and it makes me crazy. Im writing this and hoping it helps me seeing clearer. It feels like a dream.

s_2815_1557,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"Round Faces Justine ran into our room around 3 a.m. again. Third time this week. She was screaming and sobbing about the things with round faces staring at her from the window. I turned on the lamp and looked over at Carla, whose scowl was telling me it was my turn. So, off I went with Justine into her bedroom. No monsters. I kissed her forehead and told her to go back to sleep. Carla headed off to work the next morning and brought Justine to school on the way. I was left at home, like usual, to clean and do other housewifely chores. Its not that I particularly minded; Carla makes great money and we both agreed itd be good for Justine to have one of her moms around when she got home from school. Still, it was boring to be all alone in the house for so many hours of the day. Cleaning like a fiend helped, though. I like to keep the place spotless. Once Id finished the downstairs, I trudged up the steps and took care of our room and the bathroom. As I cleaned Justines, I noticed the window nearest her bed had some nasty smudges on the outside. Greasy stuff. I took the Windex and leaned out the window and got as much of it off as I could. I figured a bird mustve hit it or something. When the outside was clean, I closed the window and saw it was still greasy. It took me a second to realize the same stuff was also on the inside. I made a mental note to ask Justine what the hell she was playing with, which I promptly forgot about. The day sighed into night. We all had dinner together, watched Mulan for the 20th time, and went to bed. After midnight, in shrieked Justine. Same story. Frustrated and weary, I got out of bed before Carla, picked up Justine, and carried her to her room. I yanked back the covers and got into bed with her. She calmed down pretty quick and was out like a light in ten minutes. Of course, I was wide awake. I explored the dark bedroom with my eyes. There were a lot of weird shadows, thats for sure. Justine could pretty easily see those as monsters, especially with her imagination. Plus there was a soft, arrhythmic popping sound coming from the radiator next to the bed. I remembered how terrified of the dark I used to be when I was her age. I became barely aware of the popping sound getting louder before sleep took me. The god damn birds woke me up at 4:30 the next morning, right as the sun was starting to come up. Justine was still asleep. Behind the shrill somebody fuck me pleas of the birds, that popping sound was still going on. Without waking Justine, I slid out of bed and got close to the radiator. I could still hear the noises, but they were no louder. Only when I pressed my ear to the floor did the volume increased. There was more to the sound than just the popping. I murmured something about the mother of the guy who installed our pipes and went downstairs to put on a pot of coffee. I filled the machine with water, measured out some coffee, and flipped the switch. I turned around to grab a banana off the counter. In front of me, close enough to embrace, was something. Its body was around 5 feet tall, ashy grayish-white. Perched atop a thick neck was a round head the size of a beachball. Tiny, red eyes stared at me, looking like maraschino cherries pressed into bread dough with careless thumbs. The mouth was huge and gaping. There were no teeth, just raw nubs surrounding rows and rows of purple gums that decreased in size with each row until disappearing at the void of its four-uvulaed throat. I couldnt move. Before the first second of my scream had elapsed, the creature extruded an oily yellow bubble from the back of its throat. It enveloped my head and shoulders and I stared down its gurgling throat as I howled in terror. The thing moved closer to me, pops and clicks spilling from its mouth. As my face slid into the maw, everything changed. My eyes opened to the taste of warm pink. Scents of tangerine and honeysuckle danced through my ears as my fingers traced the wall, hearing the thumps of heartbeats. I parted my lips to see four of the creatures facing one another. Their mouths oozed thick, yellow fluid onto my kitchen floor. I walked over to them and put my hand on one of their heads. It turned around and followed me up the stairs, yellow fluid wetting our feet as we walked. We first visited Justines room. Shed just woken up. She, too, screamed, but was enveloped in a mucousy bubble as quickly as I had been. Once her head disappeared into the mouth of the creature, she was okay. We held hands as we walked into the bedroom where Carla still slept. This time, the creature floated through the air and hovered above my sleeping wife. The fluid that stopped gouting from its mouth when it bubbled Justine began to flow again. Carla woke instantly, her gasping yell muffled by the vomitous liquid splashing on her face and down her throat. She thrashed and struggled to move, but, for whatever reason, she couldnt get up. The liquid became viscous and dark, verging on orange. It was then we saw steam rising from Carla. As Justine and I watched, Carla dissolved. It took a little while; nearly an hour. I looked over at Justine and thought her eyes looked brighter than usual, even a little red. And her smile was so much wider. I grinned, also, feeling the corners of my mouth touch my ears. We mounted the bed and dragged our tongues across the pulp that was once Carla. She burned a little as we swallowed, but we quickly got used to it. Our friend still floated above us, its mouth extruding a thick, greasy bubble. Justine and I reached up to touch it, letting it run between our fingers and down our arms. When the bubble hit our faces, the creature moved downward to take our heads in its mouth. Like the last time, everything changed again. We were back to normal. No creatures, no weird sensory or facial changes. Just stunned, amnesic confusion. Justine immediately fell asleep in my lap. I couldnt imagine what kind of stress she must have been under. The same went for me, too. Stress always made me tired, and now I was exhausted. I fell back on the bed. It took me a moment to realize why the bed was soaked. After another moment, I figured out what the taste in my mouth was.","Stress always made me tired, and now I was exhausted.",5998,5,1

s_1768_341,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"[Help] First time posting in here, starting to lose myself to the anxiety again. Hello r/anxiety, I hope it is ok for my first post here to be asking for help. I have been dealing with anxiety since I was a child (5/6 years old) and have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and probable Panic Disorder (waiting to see a counsellor for formal diagnosis) I also have depressive issues caused by the anxiety episodes. I take citalopram 10mg daily as a maintainance dose, and for the last two years, this has been working really well, and the anxiety attacks have been managable. I have also had a series of CBT sessions, and one on one counselling sessions to provide ways for me to cope with the anxiety. I used the Australian 'What, me, worry?' program during my most recent CBT. But I digress from my current problem. A few weeks ago, my grandad (dads dad) was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. A few days later it was declared inoperable and untreatable. He has been given about 10 weeks at most to live, though he is deteriorating fast and the cancer is spreading aggresively. I am currently living in the USA and my family are all in the UK. I am travelling home next week to hopefully spend some time with him before he passes. Since my dad told me about his diagnosis, I have been struggling more and more each day with my anxiety. I have started having panic attacks at night, some that are waxing and waining all night. Recently I had a panic attack that started at 7pm(ish) and came on and off in 10 minute cycles until around 4am. The panic attacks are causing me to suffer from upset stomach and nausea (IBS stress related), but because one of my triggers is fear of vomiting, this in turn causes me to have greater anxiety, and more panic attacks. I am getting very tired now, from lack of sleep, and the physical exertion of the panic attacks. I can feel that I am shrinking back into my head, unable to get out of this vicious cycle of panic and fear of panic. I am starting to feel detached from the day to day family life I have, and I am just going through the motions each day, doing the jobs I always do, just to make things seem normal for everyone else. I am getting scared that this is not going to end. I am scared of everything at the moment to be honest. I am living right on the edge of breakdown and really don't know which way I am going to fall. My husband tries his best to help me, but having never had a problem with anxiety, and being the most laid back person I know, he finds it hard to understand why I can't just snap out of this, think positive, don't worry etc. I am calling my doctor tomorrow to make an appointment this week. Hopefully we can work something out to get me through the next few weeks. So, I guess what I am asking you r/anxiety, is for any tips, thoughts or experiences that will make me be able to see that this will end, that I will get through this. And how to keep the anxiety demons at bay. Thank you xxxx","I am getting very tired now, from lack of sleep, and the physical exertion of the panic attacks.",1770,5,1
s_1601_96,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I was lucky enough to have attended private school all of my life (except for two months, since I emigrated in April during 2nd grade, and only public school allowed me to get in for the remaining two months). From Grade 5, I attended a catholic smallish school, and on top of that, from Grade 7 to Senior Year, we were all girls. Bullying didn't really happen, and everyone fitted in (no one was left alone, unless they chose to be alone). Girls fight and hate on each other behind each other's back haha. However, my self-esteem dropped immensely some time in Grade 8. I have no idea why. I know it's related to school. I became extremely self-conscious. One of the many reasons I like to blame was that it was in Grade 8 that we started a project, which was a student exchange with kids our age in Mexico. I personally really wanted to just build a cool friendship with someone, and I was unfortunately matched with the 'hottest guy'. We talked, but soon enough I noticed him using me to get to the pretty girls of my year. When they finally came in Grade 9, I went to him to say hi, and he was like ""Hey! You're 'train_subject9951', right?"" and I was really happy he remembered me, but seconds later, he turned his back and started talking to another classmate of mine, who, for some reason, decided not to wear much that day. I was both unhappy and kind of shocked, because, well, I'm not a pretty girl. Felt like all the attention I'll ever get from there on would be from being pretty, which I am not. Girls like girls with whom they can relate to, and most girls of my school were into partying, makeup ... being stereotypical teenage girls. I was not like them. My social skills then dropped to absolute zero, my self-esteem reached an all-time low, and I slowly started secluding myself.

The only positive thing I could say about it was that I lost 50 lbs on it. I stopped my habit of emotional eating. Everything else sucked. I became an apathetic zombie. My sex drive was way down, and it has remained so after being off it for a month now. I'm now sure that I don't need an SSRI, but I do need some kind of medication. I don't have insurance to visit my doctor, but I've been going to my GP my entire life and he'll change my prescription with a free phone or email consultation. I've heard good things about sex drive and personality on Wellbutrin and I think an NDSI might help me a lot more. What side effects have you experienced on Wellbutrin?

I told my social worker what I have been feeling down and thinking suicidal thoughs which come and go away, but now she is scared for me. Which makes it worse. She wants me to go book an appt with the doctor and she wants me to tell my parents.

s_2663_69,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Meth psychosis. Baaad trip. I talked briefly about this in another thread the other day and it had been a long time since I had thought about it. So I thought it may help someone if i tell this story. This happened to me almost 20 years ago now. 20 years later its still vivid in my mind it was so traumatic. The back story. In 1998 i moved from smoking pot to doing crystal methamphetamine. I remember the first few times, I felt like a God. I felt like I had discovered some secret. That the rest of humanity were weaker beings needing to sleep. I was full of life. Full of confidence and social. When I ended the nights out and went home, id lie there so wired i couldnt even blink. In my head running over fantasy scenarios and dreaming whilst awake. Dawn would come and id drop off to sleep. I had dropped out of work and was living off benefits which I used completely to buy crystal. It felt so good. This carried on for a while, I got confident, got a girlfriend. I hadn't had one for a few years (im an ugly bastard!). My confidence spiralled into egotistical wankerdom. I believed the grains of white crystal i held in my pocket were magic. Then one night this illusion swung violently into a nightmare...
That night. I hadn't slept or eaten anything proper in days. I was wired to fuck already. I met my girlfriend, who in reality was a drugged up skank from a rough family and we went to this shitty local pub she liked. I went into the toilets and thinking ""this place is shit, I'll liven it up about"", I took out my baggy and proceeded to bomb double what I usually took. It seemed to hit almost instantly. I was in the cubicle and the rush was pure terror and anxiety. I sat there and heard a few guys come into the toilet. They were talking about me. They were plotting to beat me up. I sat there with my heart pounding and eyes bulging thinking what will I do? What will I do...
I go out cautiously and there is nobody there. I go into the pub area and my mates are playing pool and drinking. I try to pretend im ok but it must have been so obvious i wasnt. As one of my friends commented ""you need to calm down on that stuff"". My girlfriend said ""let's get out of here you look crazy"". So we went to her house which was just over the road. She said ""ill make you a brew to help you calm down"". I sat there and my mind was racing. She was in on it. I never drink brews. She was trying to poison me. Or slip me some downers so the people in the pub could beat me up. I sat in the lounge on my own. And looking around i saw some tools her dad had out, he was installing laminate floor. There was a hammer and a few other bits. Then I saw it. A retractable Stanley knife. I picked it up quietly and slipped it into my pocket. Not even thinking what the fuck I was going to do. I just knew if these fuckers came. I was going to defend myself. My girlfriend came in and gave me the brew. I put it down and obviously didn't drink that poisoned shit. The curtains were drawn, but I saw the shadows outside of a group of people. They were coming. I needed to get the fuck out of there. My girlfriend starts coming on to me. I pretended i was into it. seizing the element of surprise i push her off, jump up and shoot out of her house. I sprinted the fastest i have ever ran. Her house overlooked some fields at the back that led onto woods. I just ran and ran and ran. Once I was a good distance away i looked back and they were coming. I saw them coming. So I turned and carried on sprinting. On that night I think I'd have given Ussain Bolt a run for his money. I reached the woods and literally felt sick at the thought of going in. It must have been agouti midnight now and it was pitch black. There was no place else to go. I hurdled the fence and ran in. I found a densely overgrown spot and hid behind a tree. My heart pounding in my chest. My hand in my pocket slid out the blade of the knife...
I stayed quiet for what seemed like hours. I saw them. Theirs dark silhouettes and hooded heads. They looked big. Like body builder types. And there were loads of them. I heard them whistle to each other in some sort of code. Then the worst thing ever happened. The clouds cleared and the full moon shone bright light down, illuminating the woods and revealing where I was. I saw them moving between trees. They were playing a game. They were hunting me. ""just get it over with!!... what have I done to you??.....why are you doing this !"" I screamed into the dark. But still they didn't come. They just sort of circled around me in the woods. My mind raced to every person i might have pissed off. To think who could be behind this. I knew whoever it was, to have this many people out here in the woods. They were serious. ""COME ON! COME AND DO IT THEN! I'VE GOT A FUCKING KNIFE"" I literally screamed into the dark woods. It was probably now about 2am. The shadows just kept darting between trees only now... they looked small. Not even my height (I'm not very tall). The moon had gone back behind the clouds. But then all of a sudden a bright white beam came down from the moon to the middle of the woods. My mind then, and I remember with clarity, thought ""i cannot believe this is an alien conspiracy, oh my God im going to be abducted, ill disappear and no one will ever know what happened ""..... it sounds ludicrous in hindsight. But the terror i felt in that moment. I pulled out the knife. Id rather fucking kill myself than be taken by aliens. The time now must have been about 4am because it literally started to grow lighter....i looked around in horror. The blade of the Stanley knife to my wrist. It was like my whole soul screamed ""NO!"" The light came fast. I looked around. There was no one. I was freezing. My eyes were literally bulging out of my skull. A moment of clarity came smashing through all the horror. I collapsed to my knees and looked at myself. I was covered in mud. Id actually cut into my arm and blood ran down my hand.. I was filthy. I sat there with my head in my hands crying for ages. What had my life become. I pulled myself up and walked home. All the way, paranoid thoughts rushed through my head. People in cars stared at me. Men in white vans were going to pull up and bundle me into their vans. The reality was it was about 5am. There were hardly any cars about. The bad tripped lingered. I had to force myself not to look at the shadow people. I remember one vividly leaning on the bonnet of a car cradling a baseball bat. I forced myself to look down and just get home. Now the reality that it was a bad trip, was a thought I could understand. I felt distraught. I got home. I got into bed. And i slept for two full days. I got up after that 48 hours, and I made a serious attempt to kill myself. My mum found me unconscious. I was in hospital for 3 days. I woke up, discharged myself. And you know what? Went and scored some more meth. If you are young, or any age. Don't do that shit. It is evil. It is the worst most horrible thing. It will make you do terrible things to people you love. It will make you do terrible things to yourself. It just is not worth it. Peace guys !","I got up after that 48 hours, and I made a serious attempt to kill myself.",6679,8,1

s_2840_562,Find evidence for appetite change in this post,"I am a teenage girl who has been dealing with depression and anxiety for about a year and a half. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are things I had issues with for a long time. Before I tell my story, I want to say that finding this, and looking at some of the posts, made me feel less alone. Feeling alone is all too familiar to everyone on this subreddit, and it's amazing that a group of people who are feeling the same things and battling the same things can come together to discuss and guide each other. That's beautiful. Now for the my story. As a young child, I never fit in. I was always the weird fat girl, and living in a wealthy town full of girls with entitlement issues didn't help. My mother is very down to Earth, and since it was only her and I living together, we didn't have much money. We were by no means poor, but I didn't live in a fancy house in a nice subdivision, nor did I wear designer brand clothes like all the other kids. My parents divorced when I was two, and my dad was in and out of prison. With all of this being said, I spent most of my time alone and playing by myself when I was little. I had no siblings and no friends to play with. Then when I was 10 or 11, about to start middle school, my mother made a spur of the moment decision to move to a town about 10 or 20 miles outside the one we were living in. I was not excited. There were some bad areas of the town, and it intimidated me. My mom tried to assure me that I'd make lots of new friends and that everyone would be nicer. I didn't believe her, because I believed that kids were mean, and that's just how it was. I had no idea that there really were nice kids out there. I started middle school and everything was well, and I was amazed when I wasn't made fun of on the first day. I was very introverted, and didn't have any friends until about halfway through the school year, when I started taking to Jessie, a beautiful trumpet player in my band class who I though was extremely cool. I am still friends with her today, and I met most of my other friends though the people that Jessie knew in elementary school. 6th and 7th grade were good, and while I wasn't popular, and was still ""the weird fat girl"" in some people's eyes, I had a group of friends that I loved. I was content. Then the summer before 8th grade, my father passed away due to a prescription drug overdose. I tried to avoid it, and pretend that it never happened, which only fueled my mourning. My father wasn't perfect, and there were points where I would only see him two or three times a year, but he loved me. He adored me. In the letters he sent to my the rest of my family, he never shut up about me. The thing that hurt me the most is that the last the we talked was on the phone, and I didn't tell him I loved him. As with all deaths, I mourned and then gradually moved on with my life. When 8th grade started, all was well, and I still had the same group of friends. About halfway through the year, I developed a crush on a close friend, Brandon. He also came from a broken home, with a dead mother, an abusive father, and being in his grandparents' custody with his older brother. I told him, and in early March we started dating. I loved this boy. He was my first boyfriend, first kiss, and first everything. Being the naive young kid I was, we had sex. Because hey, if he's willing to have sex with me, that must mean he really loves me right? Well as you would expect, he broke up with me shortly afterwards, after coming on a vacation with my family and I for my birthday. About a week after my birthday, he randomly became very distant and would only talk to me briefly once every few days, where we used to FaceTime for hours and hours every day. Then one day I sent him a message and asked what was wrong, and after a short argument, he called me on FaceTime. He said he had to break up with me to ""protect me"" and we were both sobbing. I didn't hear from him for over a year. In all honesty, I never really got over him. I still have dreams about him on a nightly basis, and I think he was the thing that really fueled my depression. For once in my life, I felt a mutual love with one of my peers, and then it was gone. I now realize the he used me, and he was very controlling, but I loved him. I spent weeks and weeks crying over the breakup, but of course, I started getting over it slowly but surely. That was my first experience with cutting. I was sad, and mad at myself, so I grabbed the dull knife from the kitchen and sawed at my arm until there was a swollen cut, with blood oozing out. It felt good. The physical pain distracted me from the mental pain, and for those moments, it relieved my stress. Through freshman year, cutting was an issue. I continued to earn good grades and smile, but in marching band, a close-knit group of friends, I felt like an outsider. Jessie made new upperclassmen friends, and I was the awkward weird girl who wouldn't talk to anyone. It got really bad in the winter, and those are when the thoughts got more hostile and I felt more alone. I began more and more to sit in my room alone and listen to music, and avoid everyone around me. It was the same routine at this point: wake up, go to school or pretend I was sick, then lay and bed and sulk. I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time. I have since gotten better with eating, although the thought still rises occasionally. I was put on Zoloft when I was 14 as well as attended therapy, and it helped for a while, but now I am falling back into that pit of loneliness. We quit therapy a few months ago because it became too much money for my mom to handle. Being a teenager, I like to tell myself this is a phase, or a mere hormone imbalance, but at this point I know it's not. Nothing seems beautiful, and I can find sadness and despondence in most everything. I can't shake the lonely, worthless feeling constantly plaguing me, and I needed to tell my story to people who would understand and point me in the right direction. I really feel less alone now, and I can relate to so many of you. Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to being a supportive part of this subreddit.","I began becoming anorexic, not eating for a couple days at a time.",5276,2,1

s_2625_12,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Why do you think you will ruin someone else's happiness? I think that feeling is probably a reflection of what your mom has taught you - that you somehow affect her feelings (i.e. your depression makes her feel unhappy so it must be your fault). It's not healthy to think that way, and it probably contributing to a lot of your depression. If you haven't looked into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) I would google it. One of the main concepts of CBT is that we process events and our brain decides how to respond to it. Do you notice how certain people respond differently to events? For example, say you did poorly on a test. I might respond by thinking that I'm a failure. This thought leads to feeling very depressed. This leads to me avoiding that class, subsequently doing worse and worse and confirming my belief that I'm a failure. Now, take someone else who is maybe more positive. They do poorly on the test. They say, well, it was really hard and I didn't study as much as I should have. So they think, it doesn't mean I'm a bad person or a failure. I just need to study more. So they keep going to class, take good notes, and study for the next test, and do well. Do you see where I'm going with this? In the case of your mom, she reacts to the event of you being depressed or unhappy. She thinks, what happened to my happy boy? She probably thinks, maybe it's my fault he feels this way. I must be a terrible mother. These thoughts make her feel awful and depressed. She thinks, if only he was happy, I would be happy too. He's making me unhappy. BUT, if you look at this situation, SHE made herself unhappy by these thoughts. It's important to remember that. Don't let others make YOU feel like YOU made them feel a certain way. That was a big breaking point in my depression. It made me relax a bit. If someone is upset, that's their problem, not mine. I can't fix it. I didn't make them upset. If possible, I would look into therapy. If you can't afford therapy or don't want to, look into books on CBT. I like Feeling Good. I look at it from time to time. You can't change your family and how they react to you, but you can change how YOU react to what they say. You don't need to feel guilty for your depression because you did not choose to have it. I am on an SSRI and I have found that incredibly helpful. You can see a primary care physician and they will usually prescribe you an SSRI. If you're open to medication I would look into it!

The feeling that even doing a simple task such as picking a sock up from the floor or having a shower is like climbing a mountain. I can feel exhausted after getting ready for work in the morning. Depression can make it difficult to enjoy life and isolates you. You do seem to be going down a route of isolation if you are thinking about leaving school - but maybe the early stages. I was as you describe when I was younger. I hated school and didn't understand why I was there, I still think that schools are really just big nurseries where society puts children so that they don't cause trouble! They are not places of great education in my opinion, they are places that frequently create sheep as fodder for society. It could be the initial start of depression, I think that racing thoughts are common but they may be more linked to anxiety than depression. The smoking may be your attempt to self medicate. In the long run you may want to educate yourself on the effects of THC when not combined with CBD. It is common for skunk to have 12-15% of THC content but very little CBD. CBD is the cannabinoid that protects against mental health issues. My best advice is to talk to a counsellor or psychologist but make up your own mind as to whether to follow their advice. They often don't seem to be much use either other than for emptying your wallet - but I am maybe a little cynical as others seem to have had great success with them. Don't be afraid to change counsellors if you do go to one, find one that suits you and that you can relate to. If you have good parents then maybe you can chat with them and let them know what you are thinking and feeling. They may be able to help with support and advice. I may be scary to approach them but good parent will want to try to help. Good luck.",I can feel exhausted after getting ready for work in the morning.,223,5,1

I'm like a caricature, at least I definitely was at my heaviest weight. I was 206 some time this past summer at 5'7""ish. I bought these jeans several months ago. My old jeans were too tight, I was devastated. Couldn't even squeeze into them. Went in, managed to find two pairs - both high waisted, but one was VERY stretchy and one was not. I've been noticing lately that the stretched out pair is loose, but they shrink back up in the dryer and are fine for a wear or two. They're mostly like yoga pants. ( They do have weird stretched out bumpy spots though, which I find amusing.) These pants, though. These were a little snug even when I bought them. They are only mid-rise, I think, which usually means a giant gap at the waist when I sit down. I rarely wore these jeans in the last few months, mostly because I still couldn't really see or feel my weight loss. I decided to throw them on today as I was running late, and oh, man. I had to pull these babies up. Not like, fall-off-my-hips loose, but definitely LOOSE. They started to sag a little in the butt. I had to make sure I wasn't flashing crack to innocent bystanders.

I didn't yell but I imagine it was probably loud enough where you could hear it if you were sitting close by. She completely shut down but before our food came she started texting me. Why are we even out if you're just going to sit on your phone and walk away from me. And not even say thank you. At this point I lost it. I said ""I'm not fucking do this! right now!"" She replied something like will you lower your voice people can hear us! This is where shit really hit the fan. I said I don't fucking care! I didn't yell it, it was kind of those angry whispers. I could tell she was hurt, she got up. Grabbed two to go boxes and packed up the sandwiches. I finished my soup and we got in the rental car we have till the insurance totals my car. We didn't speak at all during the ride home. When we got home I calmly said can we talk? We started talking and I apologized for what had happened... but I made a grave mistake... I mentioned that I felt provoked. I wish she could own up to the fact she does in fact push my buttons that it isn't like I fly off the handles for no reason. * Insert foot in mouth She immediately got upset and we started yelling... it is always my knee jerk reaction to yell back when I'm being yelled at. She said"" I'm not going to sit in the car so you can yell at me! "" I told her we are both yelling.. I always try to normalize this behavior even though I know damn well it's an unhealthy way of dealing with your emotions. I swear all the shows we ever watch, somebody is fucking yelling and cursing about something. I'm pretty desensitized to it, and for her it is literally triggering. We both suffer from complex PTSD. I also have clinical depression and pretty horrible social anxiety. She is a victim of domestic and sexual abuse. Yelling at her is wrong in so many ways. It is straight up abusive.

Stomach pain, still unable to eat. Night before I had to take a Zofran just to get to sleep, the pain got so bad from trying to eat something when I was hungry (peach, v-8, whole grain goldfish). Thankfully it was not unbearable this morn, and only coming in waves about every 15 min or so. The doctor saw it three times while she was in there with me. I go from being hyper and bubbly to labored breathing and in pain. She could see I was not bullshitting around, and that I needed care and answers quick. I expressed to her that I suspected I have had untreated diabetes for a long fucking time, never knew-- and now I have thyroid problems as a result. She went over my issues with me, we talked at length about everything that's happened lately, and in my life in general. Then she felt my neck. She said, ""yeah, I want an ultrasound."" She ordered 16 blood tests, 1 urine, and an ultrasound for my neck. The last few vials, it was like my blood ran out. Luckily I have been eating nothing but fruit and veg and grains, aside my need for cookies and breads-- so I didn't pass out or get dizzy like I usually do. I honestly feel so lucky the first doc cancelled and I ended up at this ""clinic"" with a LAB! right in there. It felt more like a doc office than a clinic, it was very nice.

s_2815_1002,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"30 years ago today, my neighbor's son disappeared. 30 years ago, my neighbors across the street, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, endured a terrible loss. Their son, Adam, disappeared on Halloween. It was assumed he was kidnapped, as there was a rash of kidnappings in the area at the time. The kidnapper was never found, though. Neither was Adam. Todays the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. To the Steins, the wounds are still fresh. They refuse to decorate their yard, despite all the houses on the street going out of their way to be as festive as possible. They dont give out candy, despite the rest of the houses on the street trying to one-up each other by giving out better loot than their neighbors. The Steins mourn quietly in their dark house; the television being the only light emanating from their window. Kids are advised by their parents not to knock. Ive always felt bad for them. Ive lived here for 40 years. I remember the frantic search and rescue efforts that swept through our town. Even though I was barely 20 years old and living with my unemployed father while working double shifts to pay our mortgage, I did my part and joined the search. It was the least I could do. Like all futile searches, it ended after a while. Adam was presumed dead. The Steins grew old and the neighborhood changed around us. New families moved in and old ones either died off or moved out. Aside from me and the Steins, Id say the average age of the homeowners here is 35. And they all have lots of kids. A terrible rumor started to spread a couple years ago. I know who started it - an older kid named Chuck Demopoulos. He told his younger brothers and neighborhood friends that Adams ghost haunts the woods behind our street. He said Mr. Stein killed him and chopped him up into little bits. When I learned about the rumor, I was disgusted. The disrespect was so vulgar and uncalled for. I prayed the Steins wouldnt hear about it, but Im sure they must have. It was pervasive. I called Chucks father and told him what I heard, and I suspect Chuck caught a beating for it. Still, Im afraid the damage had already been done. Despite pitying the Steins, I dont express my sympathy by refusing to decorate my house and yard. I love Halloween. Always have. I like to see parents beaming from the street while their kids nervously ring doorbells and collect piles of candy. The spirit of the season keeps me feeling young, despite being well past my prime and having to deal with high blood-pressure. Being an old timer has its perks sometimes. I have Halloween decorations they dont sell anymore. Ghoulish stuff like hangmans nooses - things that are too politically incorrect for stores to sell. I firmly believe Halloween shouldnt be sanitized. It should be scary and unsettling. That said, there needs to be an emotional component, too. Not just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. There needs to be poignancy. Something thatll stick with you after you see it. Thats why Adam helps me decorate. After Dad died in 1989, I emptied out his safety deposit box. There was an envelope with note a note and a Polaroid photograph. All the note said was, I caught him snooping around the cellar. I had to teach him a lesson. The photograph was of fresh cement drying on the basement wall. In the middle of the night, I went into the cellar and opened the wall. Adams body was inside. My instinctive reaction was to call the police, but I was terrified Id be arrested. Theyd never believe the note. So I sealed the wall. After a while, I stopped thinking about the dead boy in the bowels of my house. Many years later, after talking with Mrs. Stein about Adam on a Halloween afternoon, I knew what I had to do. I took his remains out of the wall in 2014. He was only a skeleton. I separated the bones, splashed them with fake blood, and incorporated them into my Halloween decorations. At first, I was worried. As the days went by, though, I realized I didnt need to be concerned. The bones blended in with the rest of my decorations. Just more festive material in a neighborhood chock full of it. This morning, when I went out to get the paper, Mr. Stein was doing the same. We met in the street and chatted for a while. We talked about the Cowboys game from last night and he mentioned his wife made a spectacular coffee cake that hed bring me a piece of later. I smiled and told him that would be real nice. Before we parted ways, Mr. Stein said, I never told you how much Shannon and I appreciated all the help you gave us back when we lost Adam. We knew how busy you were. Its been 30 years today, you know. I felt guilt and sadness wash over me. Im sure hes in a better place, I told him. He nodded, and I saw tears in his eyes. He was a good boy. I know wherever he is, hes watching over us. We hugged briefly, then went back to our respective homes. I walked up the driveway, past the ghosts dangling from my trees by their nooses, and headed up my front steps. I looked at the skull hanging above the doorway. It was pointed at the Steins house.

s_1808_12,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"A Lament and confession I feel like the best thing to do to make me feel better is to confess what I feel is something Ive done terribly wrong, and to lament on why I'm feeling depressed. Ill explain my logic for this at the end of my post. Andy feedback or advice is extremely appreciated. As for the terrible thing I did wrong: Right now, im in college and about to go into my senior year in college. My parents are paying for my whole college since I am unable to take out a loan because of my parents finances, and they have set very high standards for me in terms of grades. not even a B is enough for them. They plan on moving to the other side of the country in a year next summer, and they expect me to graduate on time this next summer. The problem is I wont. I lied to them, I told a big lie saying I was going to graduate on time, I even went to the extreme of pretending to be my advisor saying that I would graduate on time. The reason I wont be able to graduate on time is because I failed calculus (something they would get extremely pissed about and might have even cut off my college funding), and some courses from a community college from a while back didnt transfer over to this college. This is bad, my parents want to be able to move and have their plans all set for next summer, and I still wont have graduated. My plan for this was to save up as much money as I can so I can get my own apartment, and take out loans without them knowing when I turn 23 in a month, since FAFSA does not take your parents finances into account for loans once you turn 23. Then I would break the news to them sometime around christmas that I wont graduate on time. Even though it seems like I solid plan I feel guilty as fuck and feel like a piece of shit for doing this. I dont deserve anything. I dont deserve happiness, I deserve to be depressed, I lied to my own parents, such a big lie
But I had no other choice. I'm so afraid of talking to my parents, and a few months ago I tried telling them the truth, but the moment I did I saw my mom getting furious at me and I got so scared and had to make up a lie saying I didnt know for sure whether I would graduate on time or not, and from there I formulated my bigger lie
I've always been afraid of my mom, I could never go to her for advice because she was always condescending and critical, and always easy to piss off, and extremely stubborn. I know she cares about me, but her attitude prevents me from confronting her about anything. I dont even know how I am going to break the news to them about not graduated on time, im really afraid. My mom has overacted to things many times before. I even remember once she threatened me saying she could make my life hell. yet at the same time she will do things like get me a birthday gift, she pays for my college, she sometimes makes breakfast. The lament: I seem to have confused hard work and suffering, and used to think that because of the suffering I have endured in life I would be rewarded. I now know thats not the case, you have to work hard to be rewarded, and I feel like the suffering I have gone through in life is extremely unjust. I missed out all of my highschool because I was very afraid of people, had low confidence and low self esteem. Im still rather afraid of people. Im not sure why im so afraid of people, maybe it was because there were times I was made fun of during middle school or when I was a kid. Maybe thats why i'm so self conscious as well about my weight and stuff
And yet people ask me to help out other people, be a kind person, turn the other cheek, and I dont see why. Why should I help others when there was never anyone to help me out in life during those hard times?! All I would have wanted during those times when I was lonely and depressed, those times when I was laying in my bed crying and weak, I just would have wanted a friend who cared enough to say its ok or to talk to. But no people are so busy with their lives they cant bother to help me when I was in pain or when I was suffering. There was a time a few years ago when I was near suicidal, where I fucked up a friendship I had with the best friend I ever had, had to take a leave of absence from school for a semester because of it, and go to a community college which was in a bad neighborhood and nowhere near as good as the university I was at. I was at rock bottom, I had pushed away the greatest friend I ever had by being to clingy (he was the greatest friend I ever had and who cared and who I trusted), i was in a shitty place in life, and no one was there. I was alone, no one was there to say things would get better or things would be alright, or to try and cheer me up or keep me from being lonely. NO ONE was there, fucking no one, I had to go through half a year of shit all by my self with no help, and I feel so fucking bitter about it
tl;dr I think this guilt is the root of my depression, my lack of motivation, my anxiety, and all these other mental problems. I dont see a light at the end of the tunnel, I see this problem as a huge mess that will destroy my life and everything I know in my life will be crushed. why bother trying to accomplish anything or improve myself when my doom is only months away. The reason why I did the lament, I listened to a speaker at a retreat about a year ago, and he said that something like this:
Trauma - lies - feelings - behavior - circumstances
1. feelings drive the behavior
2. lies drive the feelings
3. trauma drives the lies
and one of the ways to address the trauma is the write a lament. without healing the trauma, we cant change our behavior","I feel like the best thing to do to make me feel better is to confess what I feel is something Ive done terribly wrong, and to lament on why I'm feeling depressed.",24,6,1

I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life. During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an ""maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with"" ____ whatever problem I was having. After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication. I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything. Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together. Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself. She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that. TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did.","Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.",844,1,1

s_1499_15,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"It's like you're me, but me from a year ago. FH and I got engaged 12-19-15. We're getting married in September, so not completely two years but it has certainly felt like it. A long engagement has its pros and cons - the positives being more time to plan, more availability with venues, more time to save money, and more time to really fine tune what you want. I was very cool and blas about the whole thing at first. I kind of wanted a longer engagement anyway. But I got overconfident and thought ""I'll have plenty of time!"" and now I'm planning a majority of my wedding with four months to go. The extra time can absolutely feel like ages. Mentally, it seems totally reasonable to wait another few months, what's another few months in the long run, blah blah. But oh man can it get on your nerves. I wanted to be married by this last winter. We picked through venues (we live in LA but wanted a very outdoorsy wedding up a mountain and wanted somewhere that we could have the venue for the whole weekend instead of just a single day) and I basically gave up for a while. I was convinced we were never going to get married. After many, uh, unique (insane) google search terms, I stumbled upon our venue. It's everything I wanted and it's so pretty and charming it makes me want to puke. The people who own it are literally the nicest people I've ever met. I didn't find them on wedding wire or the knot or any of the specialty sites. I just started changing up my search terms, I think I found these guys through some kind of combo of ""wedding photography blog southern california mountain weekend trees"". Went through the image searches. A photographer's blog about a pretty wedding they shot is what lead me to the venue. A beautiful photo of a field near the ceremony spot. I felt like crying. I had been engaged eight months at that point and was so disheartened. I was set on this place without even seeing it in person. Once I'd found the name, I went ham on searching for more wedding blogs with pictures. It is three hours from home - not quite 3,000 miles, but still requires a hefty drive for most things - and it's not at all in the area I thought I would find something. But it is perfect. Point being, it WILL happen. I pinky promise. And it will be super annoying to feel like you're waiting forever sometimes, but you'll be grateful for the extra time, too. Enjoy being engaged. Get creative with your search. Think about how feasible it would be for you to organize vendor meetings - might require a trip for tastings but most information is easily passed on through email or skype. Think about doing an all-inclusive venue if there are any in the area - then you can see if you can do a single visit, if you love it, one more visit might do it. I'm guessing you'd be planning farther away because that's where family is - do you have any family there that could run errands for you? Trust someone's opinion on cake? That's another option.

s_1135_282,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"This is my story. A story I've never told a single soul, not family, not even my closest friends. You're the first. But it starts around the time I was 10-11. A bit of history on me first, I was a very lonely child. I never had many friends, I just kept to myself and found ways to make use of my time. So as you may imagine, I had quite a few imaginary friends growing up. I mean, it's just something you do when you're a kid. So among these friends, I had some animals, some people, just someone, or really anyone that I could talk to. But there was one in particular, one... /thing/ that stands out among all my friends. He's the reason for this story. I called him Steve, although he never gave me his name. But since he never protested Steve, I guess it stuck. He was tall and very thin, only about 6 feet tall now that I think about it, but he seemed so much taller when I was just a boy. He was quite pale, and his eyes were dark and sunk into his head, like someone who was in their final stages of a terminal illness. He always wore the same clothes though, it was this dark trench coat looking thing, with a black suit underneath. One thing that I remember most, although I didn't think about it when I was younger, was that he never spoke, or even so much as opened his mouth. His mouth. That's another thing about him. Although he never opened his mouth, I never really wanted him to. There was something about it that frightened me, just an odd shape about it. You know how if you take something familiar that you see all the time, and you change it ever so slightly to the point that it becomes something unfamiliar, and even disturbing? It was like that. It seemed to be just a tiny bit longer than a normal mouth, and it was always in a twisted sort of smile, almost as if he were mocking you. And he never opened it, but I just knew there was something terrible behind those pale, twisted lips. Maybe some huge, terrible teeth, like those alien-looking fish you see on those nature shows about the deep ocean. Whatever lie behind those lips, I knew I never wanted to see it. But moving on, there's another thing about me you should know. About the age of 11, my family life started to fall apart. My parents were always fighting, my siblings were always picking on me, and I was bullied at school with no end in sight. Eventually it became too much, and one day I just couldn't handle it anymore. So I hurt myself. I took a razor blade I found in my mom's medicine cabinet, and I just ran it across my arm and watched it bleed. It felt good. To this day, I'll never understand how it felt good, but it did. The quick, sharp pain in my arm just drowned out all the other pain in my life, at least for a while. But if I had known what it would do to me, I never would've done it. It became something I needed, something my body craved. It hurt me even worse if I DIDN'T cut myself. I couldn't stop, and eventually I had to wear long sleeves to school so that people didn't see. But the first time I did it, the first time I looked at myself in the mirror after releasing all that pain, that was the first time I saw him. He just stood in the doorway and smiled at me, while glancing at the fresh blood dripping down my arm
. Perhaps that's why he became my best friend, because he was there the time I needed someone the most, but nobody came. Except for him. He was there, every time I needed someone, every time I cut my arm or my leg, he was always there, smiling at me, looking at my freshest cut with a strange bewilderment in his eyes. Sometimes I would accidentally go a little deeper, and he would smile extra big, and sometimes even give me a quick thumbs up, as if he knew how much pleasure the pain brought, and wanted to encourage me. After about a year or so of this, I started seeing him other places too. At school, in the store, even in passing cars when we would drive down the road. But he wasn't looking at me, he would look at other people, just stare at them. He only seemed to look at me when I hurt myself. You may find this childish, but I got very jealous of that simple truth. And I would even hurt myself more often, and worse, just so I could get him to look at me more often when nobody else would. And as it went on, I noticed he had a different look in his eyes as he watched me. Almost as if he were beckoning me to come with him, to be with him, wherever he was from. It was the same look a father gives his son when it's time to go home after a long day on the playground, but at the same time, it was the same look a father gives his son when he's just gotten in trouble and it's time to come home without question. Then after a few years of this, around age 15, I made the biggest mistake of my life. I attempted to kill myself. I had no idea what I was doing, even made a few google searches just to figure out how I would do it, but I decided I couldn't take life anymore, seeing as my parents had now divorced, my mom hardly even noticed me unless I got in trouble, and the siblings that stayed with me and mom all hated my guts. It seemed like Steve was the only person who cared, who wanted me as I was. So I decided I would go home with him. I decided to fashion a noose out of some rope I had in my closet, and I hung it from my ceiling fan. After saying prayer upon prayer, and crying every drop of moisture I had in my body, I finally decided I was ready. I slowly slipped the noose around my neck, and I saw him standing there. I looked straight into his dark, sunken eyes, and then I just let my body fall upon the rope. It wasn't anything like I had expected, it was literally the worst agony I'd ever experienced. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't scream, I couldn't think, I just kept getting dizzier and dizzier, and it was all total confusion for those few seconds which felt like hours in themselves. But a few seconds in, I noticed that Steve was walking closer to me. I had never realized it before this moment, but he never walked, or even moved anything more than his eyes when I saw him. He just kind of appeared when I needed him. But this time, he walked toward me. And as I looked at his face for what I thought would be the final time, it was different. He was /laughing/ at me. My only friend in the world, the one person I could always depend on, and he was feeding off all my pain, everything important in my life, and making a mockery of it. He had wanted this all along, he had tricked me. And too late I finally saw where I had gone wrong in accepting his simple gesture of ""love"", his smile which I mistook for kindness, that turned out to be nothing but a malicious ploy for my very soul. And as he laughed and looked me in the eye, I saw his mouth open for the first, last, and only time. There was nothing. No teeth, no tongue, no black, no white, just absolute nothingness. In that instant, I knew that I had just caught a glimpse of my impending doom. I had made my foolish choice. I tried to look away, I tried to close my eyes, but his gaze held me in a viselike grip, unable to look away until he was mere inches from my face, his sneer slowly twisting into a fiendish laugh that sounded as if it was coming from the fiery pits of hell itself. And that brief moment, that one second was all it took. I now knew that I was face to face with Death, the devil himself, my ""friend"". So with my last breath, I closed my eyes and grabbed the rope, and I pulled down with all my might, hoping I could break the fan and free myself from his deathly gaze. I opened my eyes as I heard the snap of splintering wood as the fan broke, the rope fell, and suddenly all clarity rushed back into my head, and Steve was gone. For good. I never saw Steve again, and that was nearly 10 years ago now. I never cut myself or attempted to kill myself again, for fear that I would look up and see HIM. His icy cold stare, his suit as black as the moonless night, his dastardly sneer, and the nothing that lie behind it. I buried this memory in the deepest recesses of my mind, hoping it was all just a dream, my imagination. But today I saw something that changed how I saw the incident. I was browsing the internet, and I came across a post made by someone talking about their imaginary friends, and one of them I had realized bore a striking resemblance to Steve. Upon closer investigation, the person had an eerily similar experience with Steve. It was at that moment, when the icy chills ran up and down my spine, that I realized that Steve was not my imaginary friend at all. He was certainly not my friend, I had known that for years now, but now I knew that he was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, NOT imaginary. And so I write this as a warning, if you see Steve, whatever his name may be, in his black suit and coat, his pale skin, dark eyes, and that horrifically twisted smile, you need to stop what you're doing to draw him in, stop bringing pain upon yourself, and don't let him get any closer to you. Or else you could fail where I succeeded, you may end up in his prison of emptiness. You may be what lies behind his smile.",I attempted to kill myself.,4752,8,1

s_1193_416,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"""I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head. Why blame myself for all I need help for, in my head?"" Two simple lines from a song, and they've really been the perfect description for my depression. I've been dealing with depression since puberty I suppose. Lately I think I've been doing a pretty good job of getting myself out of funks, and part of it has been a personal philosophy along the lines of the title. You'll see how this is a bit awkward for me to talk about in a second, but if it helps someone else dealing with depression, than I'll be any amount of awkward required. _____
**Personal Story**
For the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, ""Stop making everything about me."" Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk. Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. I think a lot of my depression comes from ""seeing the future, in my head,"" and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. ""Why blame myself for all I need help for"" - part two. There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out. Not 3 people at once. First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third. Humiliating. Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery. I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow. It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped. Why blame myself for all I need help for? ______
**Coping mechanisms**
I feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help. But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up). 1) ""What's something around me that I can make better?"" - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork. But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people. But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. The point being - I tried to make something around me better. An attempt was made.) As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, ""I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?"" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games.

**Personal Story**
For the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, ""Stop making everything about me."" Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk. Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. I think a lot of my depression comes from ""seeing the future, in my head,"" and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. ""Why blame myself for all I need help for"" - part two. There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out. Not 3 people at once. First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third. Humiliating. Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery. I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow. It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped. Why blame myself for all I need help for? ______

I feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help. But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up). 1) ""What's something around me that I can make better?"" - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork. But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people. But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. The point being - I tried to make something around me better. An attempt was made.) As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, ""I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?"" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games.

But on bad days, I can't really seem to cope with it. I get really irritable, and my closest friends and family can't really seem to be near me. The only one who has been able to stay by me is the wonderful woman I'm dating. She always seems to know what to say or do. My biggest recommendation is to find a good brace, and an even better support system. Because otherwise, at least in my opinion, the pain may just over take you. Also, lots of ibuprofen.

s_891_797,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Pheromone Spray was Deleted so here you go! I know by the time everyone is done reading the next sentence most of you guys will be shaking your heads and calling me an idiot. I bought one of those pheromone colognes online. I never really believed in any of that, but for some odd reason, this one just seemed to make complete sense to me. Plus at only seven dollars a bottle I figured the worst case scenario is losing out on seven dollars. It was called Lust Enhancer and in 5 days it would be in my mailbox. Im not going to lie. For the next 5 days, I checked the mailbox to see if it happened to come in early but walked back into my house with a slight feeling of sadness. I just really wanted more people to pay attention to me. As a bisexual male that never got the attention of either gender I wanted, no needed, something to help me obtain some sort of romance. Im 29 years old and I havent even gone on a date before. I havent had my first kiss before. I sucked a dick back in college, but the guy never called me back or even acknowledged my presence after that. Yesterday evening when I came back from work I checked my mailbox and found a small brown box inside. I grabbed the box and ran back inside of my house. I excitedly tore open the box and a piece of paper fell out. On the top it said Instructions and right below it was only one simple sentence. One spray every 3 days. I took the small bottle out of the box and looked it over. Inside of the bottle was a thicker clear liquid. Whenever I moved the bottle the liquid slowly moved towards whatever direction the bottle was at. I set it down on the table and watched the liquid slowly settle back down. I wondered how it would come out of the bottle so I uncapped it and sprayed myself in the neck. When the liquid hit me in the neck I let out a loud gasp. It felt like water hitting my neck, but I could feel the liquid moving. I dont really know how to explain it any better other than that it felt like the liquid dug into my pores. I tried to rub out whatever was left, but my neck was completely dry. I could feel myself start to panic so I took a couple of deep breaths and started to rationalize with myself. Im just tired. Cologne does tend to dry up as soon as it touches any type of skin. The liquid was not moving. Maybe it was just running a little bit because I sprayed so close to my neck. After I managed to calm myself down I ordered a pizza. I was hungry and curious now. Whoever came up to the door will definitely be affected by the cologne if it is real. 40 minutes later someone rang my doorbell. A 30 something-year-old guy was standing outside with a pizza in his hands. I walked up closer to him and asked him what the total was. With a look of confusion on his face, he told me that it would be $14.19. I asked him if there was anything else I could pay him with, and to my excitement, his face started to go from confused to somewhat turned on. I grabbed him by his arm and pulled him inside. I wont go into details, but I got a free pizza. He was a biter which I liked, but at times he bit a little too hard. I didnt care. I loved it. I woke up this morning to see another person lying next to me for the first time. I gave him a little kiss on the cheek and he woke up. I asked him if he wanted breakfast and he nodded his head. While I was in the kitchen making some eggs and bacon he walked into the kitchen and told me that he was fired last night. He also told me that this was his first time ever doing anything with another guy. I laughed and told him to sit down. After breakfast, he started to look a little distant. He kept being short whenever I asked him a question, and by 2 pm he snuck out of my house while I used the restroom. It didnt really make me sad, though. I mean there are plenty other people around where I live. Take, for example, the lovely brunette that lives 3 doors down. I had a crush on her for the past 2 years, but I never had the courage to even talk to her. That is when I messed up. I grabbed the bottle of cologne and sprayed my neck two more times. It felt like the liquid went inside of my pores again, but this time I was fine with it. I walked over to her house and knocked on her door. When she opened her door she looked at me for a second and asked me if I lived a couple houses down from her. I laughed and told her that I did and that my vacuum cleaner just broke down. She gave me a little laugh and told me that she would go get hers for me. I was overflowing with confidence that moment. Without a second thought, I took off my shoes and walked into her house. I walked up to the little hallway she walked into and saw that she was pulling the vacuum out of a small closet. I walked up to her and hugged her from behind. She jumped up in surprise and shoved me off, but after a couple of seconds, she noticed my smell. She walked back up to me and slowly licked my cheek before I blacked out. It was nighttime when I regained consciousness. Pain erupted from all over my face. I got up from the bed and walked out the bedroom door. The girl was lying on the ground snoring. Her mouth was covered in blood. I bolted out of her house and ran back home. My cell phone was charging on my living room sofa next to the bottle of cologne. I grabbed the phone and dialed 911. I saw my face from the front facing camera on my phone. Most of my face has been torn off. There are bite marks around each gash on my face. There is almost nothing covering the bottom of my right eye. My cheeks are pretty much gone. Im in the hospital now. The doctors asked me if I remembered anything, but I remained silent. I cant blame her for this. I can only blame myself. Im here to give you all a warning. If you find a pheromone spray called Lust Enhancer get it.

That said, I still think we are good friends. I don't really have bestfriends. It's just a word that I don't use ig. I've been super busy for I've this super important test coming up that will determine my career. I've been studying for it for the past 14 months. It's in a week. I'm scared, nervous but most of all I'm mentally exhausted. Anyway, I forgot to wish them at 12am because well I forgot. I didn't forget on purpose obviously but I must admit I didn't really plan or set a reminder of any sort. This isn't new actually, I almost always forget birthdays. I would forget mine if people didn't keep reminding me. The next day, I saw it on someone else's story and freaked out because I knew that me not wishing must have upset them. I immediately texted: gt; Happy Birthday! gt; I didn't forget, I was super occupied and exhausted. Hope you understand, it's a tough week. gt; How's it going? What have you planned for for the day? They said thanks and stuff and that was the end of it. When I came back home, I called and wished again (now that I had free time). They seemed fine, nothing weird and even said that they would call me in sometime as they were out. Said okay and well that was it. Woke up next morning, and saw a text from them: gt; Sorry I didn't call, I got home late. I replied saying ""cool"" and completely forgot about it until yesterday they message me saying : gt; The way you wish happy birthday is pathetic. It's as if there's no difference between you wishing or not wishing. I was surprised to say the least for I've always wished all my friends in the same way and we're still friends so they didn't mind. Then they send this: gt; ""Happy Birthday"" gt; Like, seriously? I'd atleast expect a call from you when you know how important birthdays are for me even though you don't care about them.

She said after that she told him to leave, because she felt sorry for me. I never would've thought that anything would ever go on between them, ever. I've been around her plenty of times, and I never noticed anything between them previous to this. After about a week of thinking things through and talking with my boyfriend, I decided that I still wanted to be with him. He said that he was just horny and lonely, since at the time of the incident I had been away for two months. Then, last night, I asked him if he wants to go to bed with me (we live in his parents house and have separate bedrooms but usually sleep together), but he said that he had to stay up late to work on a paper. About 20 minutes later I go back into his room to borrow his charger, and I saw him go through about 10 photos of a pretty Korean girl on facebook. I asked him calmly what he was doing and he looked ""caught"" again and said that she was just a girl from school and that there were other people from his class in the photos too. The problem is, I know he has a thing for asian girls. He always has since I've known him (since he was 11 years old), and I've seen him looking at them plenty of times, whether it be at school, on facebook, or even when I came across a file of porn he had saved titled ""Asian Girls"". He is white and I'm only a quarter filipino, so I look white for the most part. After a week break/when we were talking through stuff, he admitted, on three occasions that I knew about but had never got a straight answer from him, that he liked three different girls (all asian) in the past, while we were together. All three girls were in relationships at the time. I think if he had the chance, something would have definitely happened... Anyway, I looked him in the eyes after he replied, and asked him to please be honest with me. He told me that she was a friend of a friend that he just noticed her in a profile picture, and decided to look through her profile bc he thought she was pretty. It just made me feel like shit. I'm glad he was honest, but I can't help it. I'll never look like all the girls he's always looking at/is interested in. It's taken a serious toll on my self-esteem. I don't know what to do at this point. It seems like this behavior will never end. However, I know he's young and so am I, and we've never been in a real relationship with anyone besides each other. I've never had a desire to be with anyone else while we we've been together. I've asked him multiple times why he wants to be in a relationship with me when it's obvious he wants to experience other people, but his response is always, ""I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't know. I love you"". I think he just has a problem with being lonely, and he likes the affection that I'm always giving him. I think it's hard for him to not have that, and maybe he's scared that he won't find/it will be a while before he does. If he finds someone while he's with me, then it would be easier for him. He'd just leave me and wouldn't have to have any lonely ""in-between"" time. He's going to Japan for a month and I don't trust him at all. I just don't know what to believe from him anymore. I always have to drag the truth out of him, and even then, I still can't tell if he's truly being honest with me. I can't imagine being without him. It kills me to think about it. But I'm wondering now if it's because leaving him would be a huge change for me. I live in Washington with him and his parents, and breaking up would probably mean going back to California to live with my family, which I don't really want to do. I talked to his mom about it and she said that I could still live here, but I think it would be too uncomfortable. Even though I told him to please leave me alone right now, he's been coming into my room and telling me he loves me and stuff, when I asked him not to come in without permission. We've been together so long, and he's all I know... I don't really have any other friends. This is probably one of the toughest decisions I've had to make thus far in my life, and I am so lost as to what to do. tl;dr: My boyfriend kissed another girl last summer, never told me about it. He's also constantly interested in other (asian) girls while he's been with me, and I'm not sure if this behavior will ever end. We've never been in a relationship with anyone besides each other, so I think he just wants to experience other people, but has never admitted to it. I can't imagine being with anyone else. Thinking about leaving kills me. I don't know what to do.","This is probably one of the toughest decisions I've had to make thus far in my life, and I am so lost as to what to do.",4625,7,1

Sorry for the slightly vague title but I recently came across this thread and I never realized my mom could be one of these but I hope someone who has put up with someone like my mother can help me understand my situation better and hopefully offer some advice as well. It might be a long story. My dad passed away when I was 11. My mom has been ""raising"" me and my sister ever since. She's also a cancer survivor which I think is a pretty noteworthy detail for context. She's a strict Muslim, never went to college and extremely traditional minded. I've been a high achiever all my life. I'm also a closeted gay man who has SEVERAL issues to say the least. Never opened up about any of them in my life but yeah, I'm depressed and suicidal. It sucks that I cannot come out to anyone I know in real life for obvious reasons. As time passed, I found my mental health deteriorating since I couldn't seek help nor even open up about it. I'm supposed to be the pillar of my family now that my father is gone so there's no chance to show vulnerability. It's taking an obvious toll on me and I'm pretty much exhausted. I feel like I'm wasting my life now and I do pretty reckless, harmful things to myself. My mother however is completely oblivious. She continues to guilt trip or emotionally blackmail me. If I under-perform in a test, she brings up the fact how she's a single mother who raised us. If I talk back or ask her to give me space because I'm an ADULT who can make his own decisions, she reminds me how she has no one left since my dad is gone. If I don't talk to her she starts pretending like her health is *worsening*. Being dramatic, faking being dizzy, not eating in front of me but acting normal when I'm not around and all that. She is AWARE that she's quite literally the only person I have left on this Earth. If she's ""gone"", no one's going to take care of me and my sister and I'm not independent enough to do that either. She takes full advantage of the fact. She'll constantly victimize herself in situations that solely affect me. She guilt tripped me into picking a career field I have LOST interest in and clearly can't excel it, simply because it was her and my late father's dream. These are BIG decisions that she's so precariously making about my life, because to her, Im a puppet of her desires. I recently caught her talking about me behind my back. She was complaining about how I'm underperforming in school to my aunt and whatever. Keep in mind that ALL MY LIFE until now, I've been an A+ student. She wasn't worried about me under-performing, she was upset that I'm not ""making her proud in the family"" like I used to before. And who cares about what I'M going through? She just wants the praise. She'll constantly remind me to ""go study"" and it BOTHERS me so much because is that all there is to life? First she makes me choose a degree I NEVER wanted to do, then she borderline forces me to study at my big age and then she acts upset when I don't listen to her? I'm an ADULT but she ONLY sees me as a vessel who's going to fulfill all her dreams and give her a life of luxury. I CAN'T HAVE MY LIFE. And the worst part is, it will ONLY get worse from here. She expects me to get married and what not. I seriously feel like I'm nothing but a toy doll. I'm not allowed to have ANYTHING of my own, just things that make HER happy. She wants grandkids, I have to give her biological grandkids. She wants a doctor for a son? I have to become the doctor. She wants a big house, nice car and lots of servant buzzing around her, I have to earn it all and give it to her. And what do I get? Constant blackmailing, torture and absolutely no sense of individuality. I don't know who I am anymore, just that I am what she wants me to be. When someone asks me what I like, I say biology, not because I like it, but because she wants me to like it. This is another stupid detail but just to add on to how fucking frustrated I am by her. I am colorblind. During my chemistry practical tests, it's hard for me to distinguish color changes and everything. I can ask for assistance but I made the dumb mistake of mentioning it to my mother. She told me I'm not colorblind, told me to NEVER tell my teachers because that's a sign of weakness and they could use that as an excuse to fail me in my practical tests and to never seek for help. It's so bad that I'm ashamed of even mentioning to anyone that I'm colorblind. Because that makes me the not perfect kid. I want to run away but I'm so emotionally attached to her, even though shes CLEARLY so toxic. I don't want to lose her. When she had cancer, it was the worst time of my life because I lost my dad and I was scared of losing her too. I was only 11 and my sister was 9. I still have that fear and I love my sister, I don't want to leave her behind but I can't live with this woman any longer. I don't wish death upon her by any means but I just desperately need a way out and it's driving me crazy that there's no way out.

The man trembled, but spoke for us. "" Sir, I've been locked up at gunpoint, given endless scans, sent into supernatural darkness, seen my squadmates torn apart and then delivered back to me, put up with endless evil sermons, even shot a friend because a mosquito got in his brain. I'm *tired* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die."" The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. "" You all feel this way?"" Nods followed. He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. "" If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not."" Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd. As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. "" Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each."" A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the moment so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun. I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built. It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make. But my two hours would feel like forever. I sat in there, sweating, frying, melting for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanity down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox. The Sword wasn't going to let us leave. It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence? What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us? I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated. I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hope
But the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in. I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same. As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face was absolutely filled with hate for that thing and I couldn't blame her but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me. It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. "" I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised."" She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. "" I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. "" This is crazy it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?"" Her gaze went distant for a moment. "" No I don't, actually."" ""Will you get one?"" I asked, desperate. She nodded. "" You're thinking neural mosquito?"" ""I'll manage it,"" she promised quietly. "" Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation."" I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave out and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn. There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heat crying. We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible. Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day. I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell. She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand. ""What'd you get?"" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up. She shook her head and showed me. "" He's clean."" ""*What?*"" ""Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering."" I remember sobbing uncontrollably. "" ""I'm sorry,"" she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. "" But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal."" She paused. "" But if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls."" I could only screw up my face and nod. And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out. There was no chatter, no murmurs no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way. It was on that day that we finally reached our objective. I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darkness
And it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides. ""Any contact with the Preacher yet?"" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays. Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack it and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night. The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place. As we watched, it shifted. Another place and another seconds later, another
This was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something* and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears. We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all. ""All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears."" This time, I knew who spoke. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: ""No, sir."" Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. "" We refuse."" ""*The Preacher must die!*"" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static. Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort of revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely? ""Set your charges,"" I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened. We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was. We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would. Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary. The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble. Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives. He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. "" Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives."" ""There's hardly time,"" someone said. ""Reed,"" the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. "" Shoot that man in the leg."" ---

s_552_54,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"So...I've actually died(suicide) Here's the thing. You won't be judged by God. But you WILL have to have to feel feel a very magnified...by like...thousands...pain in the shoes of every person you've ever hurt. We absorb this pain so that it doesn't hurt others as much in the ""now"". It means your pain is even greater than what you are experiencing. I was clinically dead for 17 minutes. I spent the Earth equivalent of what I'd call 2 weeks roughly in the indescribable, all encompassing love of God. He has always known and loved you. She would never judge you. The Devine to me feels masculine with the touch of a new mother as she holds her newborn. I'm regretting EVERY DAY I've been back because I chose to come back...only to be abandoned by the person I didn't want to see destroyed as I was shown she would be. I keep this typed up in case I think someone needs to hear it. If you have any questions you can feel free to message me. I am always there for other NDE experiencers and people who've been in a relationship with a wcluster a Cluster B. I hope you can get something positive from it. I've always believed in God. I was never a church goer or Bible beater by any means, but certainly had the feeling that something greater created us and there was a reason for this life. At times I've cussed and screamed at him that I hated him for the pain in my life. I've totally turned and lost faith at times as well. The faith I have now is rooted in a near/post death experience during a suicide attempt a few months back. I ate an entire month's supply of blood pressure medication and layed down to die. I'm actually still processing a lot of what happened and what I was shown and the knowledge and Undescribable, unconditional Love God has for ALL OF US. GOD IS LOVE, and we are all OF GOD, and we are ALL part of each other.. We are creators as well. Time is an illusion, but I spent what would be the equivalent of a couple weeks in God's Glory and kingdomthere's ways you can go too without dying(I don't recommend it) Believe it or not, we actually CHOSE this life and most of the tragedy in it. We even chose how we die. I know right?!?! WTF WERE WE THINKING?!?! I can't sit here and write the book in one sitting, but I'll bless you with some knowledge. The MEANING OF LIFE"" is something everyone wants to know, and it's a lot simpler than we all think. This life, on Earth, is not our first and won't be our last. The people closest to us have traveled with us before, and we made contracts with them for this lifetime. Earth life is a SCHOOL. It teaches one collective lesson that is truly important. HOW TO LOVE AND HOW TO BE LOVED. There's no graduating with a 4.0 either. There IS HOWEVER a pass/fail kind of thing, and if we fail ourselves or our loved ones, we gotta come back and do it again until we get it right. We also have an individual PURPOSE. This is different than meaning"". It could be as simple as a stranger watching us perform a random act of kindness and inspiring a ripple effect that goes on paying it forward for a very long time. It could be as profound as curing a disease or stopping a war. I wasn't told my purpose, but I know it's found by knowing the MEANING and loving people the best you can and accepting the love they give back. I was introduced to a soul I'd never met before I came backby choiceand she told me her name on Earth. I'd never heard this name before EVER, but it was so familiar to me when I awoke that it was etched into my mind. She said if I have questions about the afterlife to read her work, but to take it with a grain of salt because she didn't get all of it right, and that me having her name it would verify to me that what I experienced was real. Go on YouTube and listen to some of her lectures. I did, and I instantly started crying tears of extreme joy and my connection to God has never been stronger. With all the research I've done on folks that have experienced what I did, they're all VERY SIMILAR. Peter Panagore is a minister that had a very SIMILAR(not exact) NDE as mine. My story is very complicated, and though I chose to come back, I made a mistake. Ive woken up every morning in complete agony and heartbreak. I'm a pretty tough guy who, until now, hasn't cried a lot. I've cried for 7 strait months.. I'm putting g a stop to it and going home, but for those of you remaining here in this school of love, RememberI LOVE YOU! GOD LOVES YOU WAY MORE, and don't forget that. It's one more person than some people have, so go out there. Do something for someone else you don't know and don't expect a thing back. I don't care if you volunteer at a homeless shelter or give a homeless person a few dollars. Go to an old folks home and just spend some time talking to people that don't have anyone ever come see them. You pick, but you'll be AMAZED at how beautiful life becomes.

I went from 1/4 acre lot to about 250 sf of garden space. I no longer own a car, so walk, bus and ride a bike (hadn't been on one in 20 years before this) everywhere. I spend less then $200 a month for food most months. I have very, very few clothes (down from two closets full previously), one good pair of jeans, and one good pair of walking shoes. Yesterday, I got tired of washing eating utensils, so I put away all but 2 of everything except I kept out 9 spoons, because that's mostly what I eat with. I don't really need 9 spoons, but I don't want to have to keep washing them all day, so 9 it is. I share a small community garden plot close by, and I've gotten to where I hate going there, because it's just one more chore I have to do. I had huge plans for planting my courtyard but instead, I've decided to lay out an area for a few favorite plants, then fill the rest in with mulch because it's just something I have no interest in anymore. I sometimes pick up things I think I'll eventually need or can use from beside the apartment dumpsters, but lately, I've been taking dumpster finds back out to the dumpster, because I want space more than I want stuff. I think a lot about getting rid of it all and going to live in a van, traveling around the country, because I've never really seen the U.S. due to no money to travel. I don't know how long I could do that, but every time I have to do a deep clean of the apartment because it's gotten a little out of hand, I think how nice it must be only to have a tiny little van full of the essentials of life. Just now, while I was watering my indoor plants, I thought ""I should just give all of these away. What good are they to me, really?"" Plants and gardening used to be my life, and now it just seems like work. It's all just so much to take care of! My neighbor was shocked I don't have a washer and dryer, and I told her it's just one more thing to break and have to get fixed. She didn't understand how I can stand going to the laundry room to do my laundry, but I explained to her that I have so few clothes and linens now that I can do it all in two loads once a week. I wish I could do it in one. If I lived in a van, I could do it in one. I look at everything in here every day and think ""I don't need this or that or that or ..."" you get the idea. I have 5 frying pans. Who the hell needs 5 frying pans? I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of.

*These are the journal entries of Bruno Frei. They were found hidden away at the top of a lighthouse that is located on a barren cliff in Canada. As it was written in 1842, the short passages have been slightly modified so that they are easier to read in modern English. Finally, the events that took place that winter are not proven and should not be taken as fact; these could very well be hallucinations or writings to pass the time.* ___
__December 27, 1842__
The days go by and the hope of leaving seems to fade. The cold has started to permeate through the walls. I ask my Otto what we should do about our situation, even though I know that the question is meaningless. The repetition I face everyday makes me want to fall from sanity. We are stuck. We are stuck. ___
__December 28, 1842__
I suppose I should write out our backgrounds. Yesterday I was not in the right state of mind. I am Bruno Frei, of German descent and Otto Jans also is of German descent. We both were immigrated to Canada and we were living well for a while. And then we found ourselves without work and thus here we are, as lighthouse keepers. Fifteen days heretofore a massive ice storm struck the lighthouse and froze the water. Otto and I are cut off from the rest of the world until winter ends and the ice thaws. We have so many days until spring. ___
__December 29, 1842__
I am writing todays entry in the lamplight after todays event had already taken place. I am going to be frank; Ottos mind is starting to deteriorate. This morning I woke up to find Otto already awoken. He was staring out of the single window on the ground floor. Even from across the room I could hear his heavy breathing. But I ignored the signs of a man who had gone mad and traveled across the room to eat a breakfast of stale bread. As I slowly ate the bread I heard him grunt and say, Dont touch my bloody journal. I bit the side of my mouth in confusion and replied, I never touched your stuff. I woke up an hour ago and it wasnt beside my bed. So I searched everywhere in this lighthouse to no avail. And do you want to know where you put it? Out in the snow. I repeat, do not touch anything of mine. And do not (at this point, Otto was nearly shouting) put anything out in the snow! I figured saying anything would just make the situation worse, so I said nothing. Today I assumed the duties of maintaining the main light of the lighthouse. Every other day Otto and I would switch. Today he had to do nothing, which was a terrible thing. Boredom can be horrific. The view from the top of the tower was awe striking at one point, but now the constant swell of snow prevents me from seeing farther than a couple strides from the tower. Around an hour past sunset I climbed up the short ladder to a small nook in ceiling. In it I kept various pictures that I drew to keep myself from becoming insane. But today they werent there. Jumping to a conclusion, I thought that this was revenge for what I had supposedly done to Otto. So I stormed down the narrow spiral staircase and found Otto sleeping on the ground. I furiously roused him awake and after having a tense conversation with him, I decided he didnt do anything to my papers. I can tell when he lies. So today, I managed to steal Ottos journal and have my drawings get stolen. I cannot wait to leave. Spring must come sooner. ___
__December 30, 1842__
What is going on? There are voices. They say, 1827. What is Otto doing? ___
__December 31, 1842__
He says that he heard them to, but I think he is just trying to frighten me. The way he holds himself is of confidence. I am writing this entry at breakfast today, I dont want to deal with writing down how Otto frightens me today. It just makes me more fearful. Across from the small table Otto is trying to make small talk, but I cant talk to someone who is doing this to me. I am putting this journal away. What is Otto doing? ____
__January 1, 1843__
Otto does not like me anymore. Every time I say something to him he just stares at me and mumbles something back. Is he hiding something? But I have my suspicions. For the past two days and today various things around the lighthouse are being moved around. There was a ball of rope that normally rested on a shelf on the way up to the top of the tower. On the 30th, that rope was untangled around the ground floor. Otto feigned innocence, but I know it was he. It had to be. On the 31st, a butcher knife we had was stabbed into the wood lining the window. When I pulled it out, I noticed that the knife pierced out of the lighthouse to the outside world. I had to seal it up, by shoving some fabric into the thin slice. Otto feigned innocence to that. And on the 1st of the New Year, which was today, I awoke with no blankets covering me at all. It was in the dead of night. There were no lights on. The lighthouse creaked in the wind. Footsteps seemed to sound from the floorboards. There was a small lamp that I kept beside me at night. I used to not keep a lamp there and then the voices started. I lit the lamp. Shadows danced due to the flickering of the lamp. Otto flipped over in his bed. My blankets were gone and there was no chance that I would go searching for them in the dark of night. When I awoke, Otto feigned innocence. He acted confused, he acted worried. He would make a good actor for a play. I searched through all of the rooms and did not find them. They were outside. A warm fire melted the snow off of them. Now, I am going to write this next part down in the hope that Otto does not read this journal. I think Otto is trying to get me to go mad. But what did I do to merit that? Does he think that this is a game? ___
__January 2, 1843__
I found something. I was up in the top of the tower today, working the light. In my boredom I was running my hand across the bricks on the wall, when my fingers ran into something along the wall. After a quick inspection of the brick I found out that it could swing open. A secret compartment. I opened the small compartment and in it a journal sat. I carefully pulled the slim book out of the compartment and gently inspected the outside. It was maroon which golden words printed on the front. A Book for Thoughts. It was a journal. I opened it up and written in elaborate lettering was the name Isaac Walker. I carefully fingered the frail paper and flipped to the next page. On the top was the date January 4. Then there was a rumbling of the metal staircase to the top of the tower. I hurriedly shoved the journal into the wall and properly hid it. Otto reached the top of the stairs just as I faked looking out the window at the constant blizzard. He growled softly, Whatve you been doing up here. Nothing, Otto, said I. He didnt believe me, but he let it drop. I am not going to go through the entire length of the conversation, but to sum it up he attempted to reconcile to me about the past few days. He never apologized for moving things around the lighthouse, but he apologized for the lack of talking. I dont know if this is petty, but I never apologized back. I will apologize when he stops moving things around in the night. ____
__January 3, 1843__
For the first time, nothing moved around last night. And today Otto and myself seemed to be at peace with one another. Nothing much happened at all. All day I was on edge that something was going to happen. There is such a tense feeling around the lighthouse today. ____
__January 4, 1843__
After dealing with the maintenance of the light I am ready to read the journal. I dont want to lose anything about the mysterious journal, so I will be copying everything down into this journal. And as the days line up, I will be reading a passage a day and writing it down into this journal. January 4, 1827
I am writing in this journal not in the hope that it will help me, but in the hope that I can record what is happening to me. Maybe this will help someone in the future. I am trying to stay calm, but it is getting harder as the days go on. Just as a quick insight into my situation, I am a lighthouse keeper trapped inside my lighthouse alone. Things are moving around uncontrollably. I hear voices and they seem to say 1816. If I am going insane then so be it. But I fear I am not. Tonight I am going to risk my supplies and my life. I will keep the lamps on all night. Something just fell down at the bottom of the tower.* The writing stops at that and I forgot to mention that most of the bread was relocated to the top of the tower as I slept. Otto he is still feigning innocence. But I am starting to wonder
___
__January 5, 1843__
Something happened, but I have not a clue why. Did Otto and myself anger the spirits? When I woke up, Otto and his bed were gone. There was an empty space where he previously was. I ran up the spiral staircase and there the bed was. It was hung using the rope off of the framework of the lighthouse. And Otto was tied to the bed. I panicked, but after a few minutes of hyperventilating I managed to calm myself down. At first I thought he was dead, but after using the ladder I untied him to find that he merely lost his consciousness. After we had both recovered the bed, we parted. He to the top of the tower and I to the bottom. For any future readers, I would like to say that although it sounds like that didnt frighten me, you are completely mistaken. I carried the journal down to the ground floor and hid it behind my bed the day before, so here goes:
January 5, 1827
The voices are driving me insane. <PHONE> 1816. Just moments ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew. Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything. I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty. I would like to write out that I am now pretty worried. What happened to him, could happen to me. ____

The voices have been driving me insane. All through the day and into the night. But a moment ago all the lights had gone out; including the main light for the lighthouse. None of the lamps down here worked, so I had to go to the top of the tower in the dark. Every step I took my fear grew. When I thought back to the journal my eyes got tear filled. Otto looks fine. I cannot concentrate. I am worried. I must continue writing this out. This could save someone yet to come. I have decided to quote the previous journal entry, as my experience is the same as he: Must my brain be so faulted? When I reached the summit I saw a dark shape move, closer, closer, closer. But when I turned the light on, there was nothing. I swear by the light of the moon that I was not imagining anything. I fear I may not be able to muster the courage to go up to the top for a while. My emotions seem to be more important than my duty. Otto may be the only Lighthouse Keeper. January 6, 1827
God save me. God save us all. I am trapped. I cannot leave. And I have found another journal from 1827. I cannot write my findings down. It is too much. I would rather hide the thoughts away, then write them out. I know my fate and I cannot change it. I am with tears. I almost feel like I cannot continue. Maybe I should light the lighthouse on fire? Then no one will have to suffer the same fate as I will. Hope must be kept. ____________
**January 7, 1843**
The journal from 1827 offers no clue to what his fate will be. I need to know, because I fear that I will have the same fate. I have read through the rest of the journal, only three more days, and it never mentions anything else frightening. Almost as if the writer lost his sanity. I am afraid I will not copy them down, because as mentioned before the writer mustve lost his mind. Just as an insight into my situation I am currently too scared to leave the ground floor. I fear that I have turned into a lady living in a mans body but I cannot help it. Otto spends his entire day at the peak and never mentions the day with the bed. My hair has started greying. From stress I assume. But the worst part of all of this is my left hand, which I seem to have lost control to. If I attempt to curl my hand into a fist, my fingers only slightly move. What could this be from? Cold has spread in from the frigid outside. My breath turns to steam as it exits mouth. How much longer will this suffering last? Will the ice ever melt? __________________
**January 8, 1843**
*Unfortunately, due to the lack of Jan. 8 we can only assume what must have happened. We can connect that this day was a horrible day for Bruno and that he likely lost much of his mind (as the state of the next entries shows that he was basically insane). Sadly, Bruno assaulted Otto on this day; which is referenced on Jan. 13.* ______

Stop! The madness. _______
**January 10, 1843**
What is happening to me? What am I doing? I cant remember anything. Something bad happened. What happened? I do not know. Whats wrong with this damned lighthouse? I do not know. ___________
**January 11, 1843**
He is back. Otto is back. Was he ever gone? He doesnt speak to me. Have I done something? I am starting to feel like my journals are my thoughts put into papers. They are so random, so crazed. Please God, please God
Can you help? ______
**January 13, 1843**
I know what happened, but I fear that my knowledge will die with me in a short amount of time. I have accepted my fate. I cannot escape it. I am going to go tell you the story of Thursday the 12th and of today, Friday the 13th, which happens to be the date of my impending death. Otto was recovering from a knife wound. Did he stab himself? Every time I went to aid him, he would hold up a knife in defense against me. As if I was the one who cut him. I have looked back in my entries and this mustve happened on the 8th, as there seems to be no pages. I cannot bring myself to believe that I did it. Suddenly, Otto tensed up and I did as he fearing the worst. And dear God, I shouldve been more scared than I was. And then I heard the noises. They were coming from the tower. They were getting closer and coming from the spiral staircase. Otto and myself looked to each other. I looked at him for assistance and he looked at me with anger. We couldnt go anywhere. So I did the only thing that I could possibly do. I ran outside. The evening sun shone from the horizon in all its glory. I could still hear the footsteps on the metal steps. I grasped my ears and collapsed down onto the ground. The sound still penetrated. And then there was a massive wave of sound, sounding like what I can only assume a gun does. I stood up shakily and made my way to behind the lighthouse. I was upset at everything. I was frigid in the outside and since the noises had stopped I went back inside. As soon as I got in the door shook behind me and shut, locking itself. I panicked and tried to escape; I couldnt. I sprinted up to the peak of the lighthouse and here I am now. Hours passed. Nothing happened. I locked the door into the top. God, help there, I hear the steps. They are the steps of the phantom. Each step I hear. With each step my death comes closer. The phantom has entered the body and mind of Otto. He is hunting me. I fear the phantom had gone into me on the 8th and I stabbed Otto. When Otto gets up here he will kill me and then he will bring the bloody blade to his chest and stab himself. It has happened before and will happen again. God damned life! Hes at the door. The door is (unreadable scribbles)

s_186_136,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"The place Im looking at for surgery doesn't recommend lap bands anymore. They also don't recommend or do duodenal switches as far as I have heard. I THINK, it's because the results aren't as good. But also because it's a foreign object in your body and if you dislodge it or have complications they have to operate to remove it and usually dont put another one in due to trauma or whatever caused by the one that came loose. I know of at least one person who had the lap band and had major complications with it, resulting in them having a herniated stomach, where the stomach moves up into the ribcage area. And then because of that, the bile of the stomach would collect in their esophagus when they slept....
They are getting a gastric sleeve as a replacement for the removal of the lap band to go along with the surgery to fix the herniation. Im looking at getting the gastric sleeve, I am......150-200 pounds over my ""goal weight"" depending on where I want to end up. Your weight loss should be based on your BMI as well, a short person 70 pounds over weight is worse off than a very tall person 100 pounds overweight. The tall (man presumably) is going to lose the weight faster just due to their size and will take less a calorie cut to see results. Where a short woman will have to cut pretty significantly to see results most likely. Also my surgery choice also does not recommend exercise at first if you are higher on the BMI scale because of possible injuries. I think it also helps you to better determine a diet you will lose weight on no matter what. Then add in exercise when you feel your energy levels and ability to more easily carry the rest of the weight increase. A number of people post surgery talk about their energy levels being crazy high, I guess due to the hormone changes and more protein intense diet. But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released. Plus you don't get those little ""food highs"" if you cut out your trigger foods. For surgery, IF you struggle to lose and keep weight off, get the surgery. It'll depend on your BMI, but if you keep going back and forth, eventually you're going to get tired of it and say screw it. Plus wouldn't you like to be skinnier and healthier, earlier rather than later? I wish I had the option 10 years ago, and so does everyone else I've talked to. They wish they could have did it much earlier in life and the majority of them say ""I was fat for as long as I can remember."" Or at least since their teens, it's no way to live if you're unhappy with it and it only gets worse as you age and your body starts to have medical issues due to it.","But I've lost about 30-40 on my own so far and havent felt any major changes in energy levels, in fact I think the weight loss might be causing my depression to become worse due to the stored fat being burned containing hormones and them being released.",1833,5,1

Who was going to become now? Was I going to become someone evil? The feeling of depression made me think my soul was gone rotten. I started reading the bible to learn how to live properly, but all I could see was condemnation and I became convinced I was going to hell. A particular line where Jesus says something like 'you shouldn't even imagine being with your neighbour's wife because it's the same as doing it' (I'm paraphrasing) convinced me to think a sinful thought was the same as committing that sin. I thought, ok, I must not think any sinful thoughts. Which of course, sparked them off. Everytime I had a violent thought I freaked out and tried to suppress it or pulverise that part of my mind. All this just made the thoughts stronger and more persistent.

However one thing has not changed: I feel gross. I am not even affected by how society views this ""normal and healthy"" part of a female's life. Whatever people say, periods are gross. It smells, it's uncomfortable, it's messy, and there's no way to control it. I'm pretty sure if once a month, the anus decided to evacuate on its own for six days straight and all you could do is sit in a diaper at all time, it would feel the same way. One week a month, I stop working. I lose my appetite, I lose my motivation and my energy. I lose my focus and my memory as well. All my movements feel automated. I hate leaving my room when it happens. All I do is go back-and-forth between there and the bathroom. Being in College and all, I obviously have to leave my house almost every day, but I spend most of my time worrying about leakage and smell. No amount of good hygienes will change the fact that as I'm sitting down in the middle of 30+ people, blood is coming out of my vagina, and I'm sitting in it. I could shower thrice a day, change my pad every hour or empty a bottle of perfume on my nether region, nothing would change. I am amazed at how very few females seem affected by their period. I applaud those women. Unfortunately I am not at their level. I cannot stop thinking about what is happening between my legs because I can feel it. I don't like this feeling of uncleanness, as if I haven't wiped in a year. I cannot deal with this smell I can't seem to detach myself from, even though now I've learned it's all in my head. I can't deal with the fact that it leads to my inactivity, as if my body is slowly shutting down on me. It's been nearly a decade and I still haven't gotten my shit together. I've failed mother nature.",I lose my focus and my memory as well.,1258,7,1

s_313_929,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"[Book Ends 1] Night Driving I awoke to the sound of glass breaking. Then I felt the impact of the car and the seatbelt digging into my stomach and shoulder. I'd been driving two hours to my new job for three months. A job isn't even ""new"" at that point, I guess, it's just a job. The last week, I'd stepped up the amount of hours and I couldn't even remember seeing the sun. I went to work before dawn and got back after midnight every single day. It was too much, I guess, and I fell asleep. I blamed myself every day for it. I thought about all the things I might have been able to do to prevent it. I just... couldn't take it back. I went to her funeral. It felt wrong not to for some reason. Almost no one was there. Two middle-aged people I'd assumed to be her parents, an elderly man and the priest. Everything was extremely formal, dry and felt pre-packaged. The words that were said felt fake. It was a Hallmark funeral. Afterwards, I went to talk to the girl's parents. I had to apologize in person, despite the advice of my lawyers. ""Excuse me? Sorry... I..."" My tongue twisted. Maybe I should have written something down. But then, bizarrely, they both smiled and shook my hand. "" We know who you are. Thank you so much."" I was shocked. Even more, I was offended. What about the girl we'd just buried? Didn't she deserve... some emotion? Some hate for her killer? ""Krista was a troubled child. I don't know how you could understand without having met her."" ""Yes, deeply troubled."" ""You see, we used to have four children."" ""And now... well, now we have none."" ""It was Krista."" ""We can't prove that - ""
""But we know it was her. They all died in their sleep."" ""She posed their bodies."" ""They looked so peaceful."" Tears were welling in both of their eyes. I felt sick. ""She finally looked peaceful, sir. So thank you."" ""Thank you so much."" I was glad that I went to the funeral.

s_264_2,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"I was at a dinner party with a few friends one time. It was me, my best friend, a few couples, the hosts family (husband, wife, three kids) and the grand parents. At the end of the day everyone was leaving and the kids were all begging to sleep over at their grandparents house. For whatever reason the dad said no, I forget why. Anyhow, everyone goes home and sleeps off the light beer and appetizers. The next day I got a call for the host. It was an 'invitation' for his father in law's funeral, the very same one that I had seen at the party last night. Apparently, when the grandparents had gotten home last night there was someone already hiding inside their house waiting for them. He waited until they were asleep to sneak up and stab the grandfather to death. His wife was also stabbed, but she managed to make it outside where a neighbor saw her and was able to help her. She was taken to the hospital where she was treated for minor injures. While she was there the same man that had broken into their house came strolling through the hospitals front door. In his trial the grandma claimed that as he walked by he stared at her and smiled. Apparently he had somehow cut himself during the attack, and a neighbor who had no idea what was going on insisted they take him to the hospital. The very hospital the wife of the man he had just murdered was at. Creepy as shit. He was arrested shortly after being treated, thank god. **TL;DR A man hid in my friends parent's house and waited for them to go to sleep to murder them. The wife escaped and was taken to the hospital. The attacker soon showed up at the same hospital.** nbsp;

EDIT: I got one more I wasn't planning on using but decided to anyways. One week my best friends parents went out of town. It was the first time they ever out of town without him so it was kind of a big deal. We were pretty young, so we didn't throw a party or anything, but we did have an awesome unsupervised sleep over at his house. I quickly realized I greatly under estimated how scary this would be. His family was rich and he had a **huge** house. Seeing such a big dark empty house was pretty frightening for both of us. We spent most of the night playing video games in the basement. The next morning when I was getting ready to leave I kept looking for my laptop. I had brought it over to watch a movie we ended up never seeing, but now I couldn't find it. I told my friend I swore I left it on the kitchen table upstairs with the rest of my stuff. My friend decided this was the perfect opportunity to show off a little and show me the security camera terminal his dad had shown him how to use before leaving. I knew he just wanted to brag a little bit that he could even do that, but I figured it might actually help find where I had gone with it. Plus, although I'll never admit it, a security camera terminal sounded really cool and I kinda wanted to see it. Although there was no camera in his kitchen, the camera nearest clearly showed that I had gone into the room with it (as well as with the rest of my stuff) and came out without it. Naturally, we both assumed the worst. We kept watching though because I insisted that if *I* didn't move it, it must have been *him* that did it some other time that night. At about two in the morning a man walked past the camera. A very big man with a bat. He came into the shot, looked around for a moment, and then walked into the kitchen. Naturally, we freaked the fuck out. We checked the other cameras for that time. After piecing together the video like a puzzle, we saw that he walked up to every door in the house and tried to open it. The screen door on the side was unlocked. He walked in, and did a preliminary tour of the house. Then he left out the door for a moment, and returned minutes later without the bat. This time he grabbed some stuff from my friend's dad's office, a computer and my laptop. He also took some jewelry, but we didn't find out until later as that was of camera. After collecting his prize, he closed the side door, and left. If my computer hadn't been gone, I would have never known he was there. I couldn't sleep for weeks after this. A man broke in and robbed the place while I was in the house. That can be pretty god damn traumatic for a kid. A few years later the police got the guy. I never got my computer back though. **TL;DR Slept over at my friends house while his parents were away, house was robbed while we were sleeping inside.**",I couldn't sleep for weeks after this.,4141,3,1

I am sure a lot of people would be curious as to how that felt so let me start from how I got there. I tried to be a good person, but my horrible temper always got in the way. It was to the point to where I no longer had friends. My family stopped talking to me, including my own mother, father, and two sisters. I was only 21 years old, but I was truly alone. I tried to blame everyone around me, but I knew, deep down, that it was my own fault. Enough of my sob story. Let me tell you how I died. I got off of my shift at the local grocery store and was walking back home. On the way home, a man walked up to me and asked, Hey man, could you spare some cash? I lost my job a couple of days ago and I need to get some type of food for my kids. He pointed at a hungry boy and girl sitting behind him, but I scoffed and said, Not that hard to get a job. Why did you even procreate when youre fucking trash? I gave him a quick chuckle and walked past him when I felt pain erupt from my lower back. The next couple of seconds were filled with a knife plunging into my chest. I dont know when I blacked out, but the next thing I remember was opening my eyes and seeing a woman sitting close to my head and saying, Stay calm. Were almost there. Stay with-. I blacked out again and before I knew it I was met by a sense of absolute peace. Before I opened my eyes, I knew I was floating. When I opened my eyes I saw myself floating through a fog of memories. Through the fog, I could see myself yelling and cussing out my parents a year ago before storming out of their house. That was the last time I saw them. The next thing I saw was the time I was pulled over by the cops with my best friend since we were 6, Brad. He was there for me whenever I needed someone the most, but I took advantage of that. When a cop pulled us over I took out the 7 grams of coke out of my pocket and threw it on the car seat behind me. Brad looked at me with pleading eyes while the cops cuffed him, but I acted oblivious to everything. I closed my eyes again and did not open them until I felt solid ground under my feet. With a deep sigh, I opened my eyes and saw around 20 to 30 people standing in front of me. I looked down and saw that we were standing on a clear glass of some sort. When I looked back up I saw that I was next in line. I rushed up to a man that stood in front of the largest gate I have ever seen in my life. The gate was simple, but it looked to be made of solid gold. After ogling at the gate for a couple of seconds I looked down at the man in front of me. He was maybe a little over 4 feet tall, poorly maintained facial hair that covered half of his face, and eyes filled with sadness and disappointment. I opened my mouth to ask him who he was, but before I could get a sound out he spoke in a raspy voice, Nathan Cliff, enter through the gates. Although I was confused, I rushed through the gates and looked around. A road paved with gold, bodies made of solid light walking around everywhere, and other people walking around with dreamy expressions on their faces. Besides the people that walked around me, everything around me was a mixture of absolutely pure light. Something far brighter and crisper than anything I have ever seen. The only thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was a man dressed in all red with a piece of paper. Written on the piece of the paper was the date. Somehow, whenever the man flipped the paper over it gave the date of the next day, and an endless swarm of people surrounded the man. The first 50 years passed by quickly. I met a lot of other people, we talked about our lives, but I quickly became bored. You can only talk to so many people before their lives start sounding the same. We never grew hungry, tired, or thirsty, but it never ended my cravings. I wanted to get a good nights rest. I wanted to eat just one carrot and savor all of the taste. I wanted to quench a thirst with a cool glass of water, but all we had was each other and those damn angels that never said a word to anyone. For the next 110 years, I reflected back on my life. It may seem like a long time to think about 21 years of life, but you can learn a lot more about your life just by revisiting the same memory thousands of times. You learn to see things in more than just your perspective, in ways much more than the words said. It took me 160 years to finally snap. I dont know what came over me, but I wanted to leave this place. I wanted to go to hell. Anything would be better than here. This is when everything around me started to fall apart. It started with me walking up to the bodies of light we called the angels. I tried talking to them, but they never responded back to a word I said. When I truly became desperate, I tried to attack them in any way possible, but anything I struck them with would just go through them. With every attempt, they just looked at them and said the same thing. Keep searching. Keep walking. For you will find the answer. Eighty years have gone by since then, and all I have done was failed attempts of attacking other angels as well as asking everyone else if they knew what the answer was. Everything was a failure. I started to give up hope, but I started on the longest journey of my life. I turned around and started running as fast as I could. I would still see the man flip the sign over and tell us what the next day was. It was annoying at times, but it was really the only thing that kept me from going insane. 55 years go by. It is now my 295th year in Heaven, and I started to see the gate I walked through three lifetimes ago. Three years of constant running and I dont feel like Im any closer, but the scenery around me changes. I am now surrounded by body parts and blood lying all around where I run. I came across a couple of heads, and whenever I see each one I stop running and asking them what happened. Each of them said the same exact thing, Dont look for the truth. The truth wont help you. Endure the punishment. It only gets worse from here. I started to get scared. Not just scared for my life. This was far more. I was scared for my soul. The part that will never die. The part that will suffer for all eternity. No matter how bad we were cut up, sliced open, or just cut into dozens of pieces like the people around me now, I would not be able to leave. This was a punishment that will never end. After three years of running and hearing the same thing over and over again, I started to second guess myself, but I needed to know. It was beyond curiosity. I was trying to get out of the eternal suffering I ended up in. Two years later and the start of my 300th year I approached the gates. I walked up to the man that stood in the front of the gate and fell to my knees, a defeated man. He looked at me with the same eyes that were filled with disappointment and sadness before saying, Nathan Cliff. Poor Nathan Cliff. I begged him to let me out. To let me leave, but he simply said back, Learn the truth and you may leave. In between heavy breaths of panic, I replied back, They told me you would tell me the truth. Or that I would find the truth on my way here. He simply said back, You know the truth. I said the first thing in my mind Is this Hell? He chuckled and said, No. You are in Heaven, but what makes you think Heaven is for the good? You left the paradise created by God. The paradise ruined by us. We can blame the devil all we want, but we are the ones that continue to do wrong. Do you think Lucifer continues to spread his lies to the people when the lies are spread for him? I wanted to argue with him, but deep down I knew that was the truth. Humans are truly what ruined the world God made us. Lucifer may have tempted us, but we are the ones that truly ruined it. I woke back up and saw the woman that was talking to me before I lived through the scariest experience of my life. She calmly said, Dont worry. Youre back now. Dont go on us. Were almost there. I knew she was mostly saying it for herself, but I gave her my best attempt of a nod. She put the defibrillator back down and we were silent for the rest of the ride. Im in the hospital now. I learned that I was dead for 45 seconds. 45 seconds that created exactly 300 years for me. Im on my phone now. The doctors are done treating me. Pain is still erupting all over my body, but man does it feel good. I have a tray of food in front of me. Carrot sticks that I never liked, but it is bursting with flavor for me. Water that is quenching my parched throat, and after I post this experience to you guys I am going to enjoy a [good nights rest.] ( <URL>)","I tried to blame everyone around me, but I knew, deep down, that it was my own fault.",479,6,1

If I'm shouting angrily at someone in my dream then chances are I will shout it out loud too, waking us both up. It's become so routine (happens at least once or twice a month, usually more often during periods of stress or whatever) that we just accept it by now. I'll mumble a quick ""sorry"" and we'll both be back asleep again in seconds. I've also hit him in my sleep a few times, usually pretty hard, I always feel really bad about it, especially seeing as I'm normally half awake as I do it, and realise just as I thump him that whatever I was fighting in my dream is actually just my sleeping SO. The first time I did it was only a week or so into our relationship, felt so so guilty about. I'd done the shouting thing before with a previous partner, but the hitting is a recent thing (I must sound like such a terrible person now, omg, he's pretty chill about it thankfully and teases me about it). I'm honestly not an angry person or anything, IRL I'm really normally passive and quiet and would never hit anybody and rarely shout, nor do I tend to have particularly violent dreams. But if I do have them, chances are my boyfriend is gonna get hit or sworn at. (Damn, he's tolerant, I'm going to go hug him right now...)

s_1175_1063,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"[Remorse] I watched a homeless woman die, and couldn't do anything to save her. [Remorse]: If you feel bad. This is something that happened to me awhile ago when I was 11. I figured writing it somewhere would help me feel better-ish. I'm just going to type it how it's written in my little manifesto of mine. Back in 2009, or 2008? I can't remember the year but it was awhile ago. I'm 17 and it happened when I was 11 for reference. When I was younger I took a grand trip to Canada, Alaska, and Seattle with my grandparents and my cousin. The cruise started from port in West Seattle (like by the Space Needle-ish and the cool stuff.) When we arrived in Seattle we decided to stay at a hotel for three days to visit the Dry Soda Company (I saw it on Food Network and was curious) the Space Needle, and, regretfully, the famous Pikes Place Market. Well, not regretfully as in going there was bad, but the market is a dark place in my mind because of my experience. We explored the lights and sounds, and shopped the first day. That was amazing. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. Well, the ""supreme travel itinerary"" as my grandma dubbed it, was that we'd go to the Pikes Place market on the second day. Now, I don't know how it looks now, but when I visited there were a lot of homeless people. My grandparents told me not to pay any mind to them and to ignore them. This made me sad. A blemish of sorts, but it didn't deter me from the whole face of Seattle. I remember that whole morning as vivid as yesterday. I woke up, ignored the not-so-inviting continental breakfast and waited for my grandparents to finish. Hell, I even remember playing Yoshi's Island DS on my DS Lite. Well, they were always cheap. They finished up and we were off. As soon as we left the entrance we were greeted by a young women. She was obviously homeless by the tattered clothes and McDonalds cup with loose change in it. She melled like pot and paint thinner. She looked hungry and distraught. Her haggard frame didn't take away from her still young looking face. She seemed to be in her late 20's or early 30's from what I recall. Anyways, I remember reaching for my pokemon themed wallet with the intent to give her change. As I went to rummage for a penny or two my grandpa scolded me and snatched the wallet from my hands. "" No test_subject8195"" he said, ""There's a reason she's like that."" ""There's a reason she's like that."" That stuck with me. It still sticks with me. Here was this human being reduced to the status of a stray dog, and he said that. I remember sighing, still shocked at his demeanor, and trailing behind them. I remember seeing a young gentlemen, probably a concierge or a bag boy, chase her off. "" I remember thinking. Fast forward through a sea of cardboard pleas, winos, and street performers and we reached our destination. Pikes Place Market. I remember splitting off from my grandparents and cousin while watching a young gentlemen toss a fish around and do other tricks. After he was finished I clapped, and turned around. My grandparents were nowhere to be found and I was caught in a sea of fish smell, patrons, and the sinking feeling that I was inevitably fucked. I scrambled through the crowd to no avail. The thick smog of bodies clouded my view, and my calls for help went unanswered. After breaking through the crowd I found a back alley. Scared, confused, and hoping for a break from the hustle and bustle I walked through the alley. Torn flyers, waste bins, and other arrangements of junk littered the passage. Then I heard it. The sound that haunts my dreams and my mind when it wanders. Gurgling. A low mumbling gurgle laced with coughs and the unmistakable sound of struggling. It sounded rather odd, but my adventurous 11 year old brain led me to the source. Oh how I wish it didn't. How I wish I would have just sauntered off or turned around. I walked over to a tipped over trashcan, and a dumpster. I didn't know what to expect, but it wasn't like the movies. It wasn't slow, but it was silent. Save for the god awful gurgling and struggling. I even remember the picture on what I now assume was a craft beer bottle strewn along with the forgotten waste. There was a rabbit with a shit eating grin on its face giving a thumbs up. Soon after seeing that my eyes led me to the source of the sounds. It was a kneeling yet slumped, convulsing pile. Then she looked up. It was the homeless woman from earlier. I stumbled back and recoiled in fear. "" She must have knocked over the trash can and hurt herself"" I thought. The thought seems innocent now, and I wish it would have been the case. Her tattered black hoodie was caked in what appeared to be vomit and bodily fluids. It was still fresh because I remember the smell overwhelming me. Then I saw it, there was a needle jutting out of her arm. At the time I couldn't comprehend what it was, or why the woman was acting so strange. It's that innocence I wish I could still possess. But no, this woman was overdosing. She was dying. In front of my eyes, this woman was dying and I couldn't do jack shit to save her. I was a kid, and I was afraid. She looked up at me and her lips seemed to try to form words, but nothing happened. Merely shaking and more trembling before she fell and slumped even further on to the grimey alley ground. The look still haunts me, it still causes me to have panic attacks or throw up if I picture it well enough. The best way I can explain it without forcing myself to think too much about it, is milk with a little blue dye in it. That's what her skin looked like. She feebly reached out at my pant leg. I stepped back more, and then she slumped over. I wasn't sure if she was dead, but I nudged her with my foot. She didn't move. She was dead, she had to be. I screamed. I screamed louder than I ever will in my life. I ran after that, probably the fastest I'd ever run too. I ran back the way I came, past the stupid fucking rabbit bottle, past the flyers, past the market area where I was before. I only stopped when I reached the gift shop area. I cried more than I ever will I think. I never cared for my grandparents, let alone any of my relatives, but I was elated to find them browsing the selection of shirts. They were wondering why I was crying. I eluded to the fact that I watched a woman die, and rather just told them I was hysterical because I was lost. I still wish that was the case looking back. I feel, like a part of me died when that woman died. I feel like watching anybody die an untimely and violent death would kill something inside of anybody. Seattle was, and is, a beautiful city with beautiful sights. I am never going back there though. I'm going to leave whatever part of me died there. That's the way it's meant to be.",I cried more than I ever will I think.,6088,0,1

I left for now. I didn't realise that my boyfriend - who lives so far away from me - would actually take me in. It never crossed my mind because of the distance and because I didn't want to impose myself on him and his family. I thought that I had no one at all, but apparently his family had offered to take me in a while ago. I told him I was having issues and he said that I can come live with him, his sister and his parents, and he helped me pack and leave. We'll be back later in the week for the rest of my stuff. When he came to see me, he saw how abusive my sisters were becoming when one of them decided to smash my door down and destroy the fifth lock I had to install, because they wouldn't stop breaking them. She started shouting some particularly nasty things at me and also tried to get him to break up with me as she was putting me down. I just had a complete breakdown. He also took me to see a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with depression and they suspect borderline personality disorder, which is apparently due to my abusive childhood eventually leaving me unable to cope with stress in a productive way. I'm being prescribed mood stabilisers. It's sad when you realise that your family has never loved you. They just said I was running away from my responsibilities and said they'd sell the animals when I'm gone. I'm at least planning to get the rabbits this week.

I hope that if I can pass on some things that have taken me years to learn about myself, maybe it will give you a different perspective and/or make it easier for you to learn about yourself. It took a while for me to get out of the mindset of being isolated. I am not saying to follow my path but explaining where I came from and how things changed. If I could have changed things earlier I would have had a better life sooner. I've always been a bit different to other people and when I was in high school and university that was really to my detriment. I was very lonely for a very long time and also very depressed. But the hurt that I suffered made me strive for a better life so that I could be independent financially and have more control over my own life. That was my #1 priority. I struggled and worked really hard to do that. I wasn't successful at first, in fact, the opposite, so I worked even harder. Years later, I got there and got the independence I wanted. You'd think by then, being successful, I would be happy right? But by this point I'd gotten into a habit of striving for perfection, and I was not at all happy with myself. I was always thinking I wasn't good enough and putting myself down in my head. Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself. And that is when I let other people in, once I could be okay with myself and not always judge myself in a negative way. It was hard at first and people did let me down occasionally but I suppose in the end I learnt my own self-worth and it made me more resilient. I am still closed off a little bit and don't let people in so easily and freely as other people but I feel comfortable at this level of disclosure. :) What I hope you can take away from all of my lessons is that you are a worthy person. People always say ""nobody's perfect"" but it's become a cliche and it's almost a throwaway comment as it doesn't really matter about everyone else, 'cause we're talking about you. You're not perfect, and that's completely okay. You are a valuable person who matters. You can live your life in a way that means something to you. You do need to be careful with your trust but not completely abandon giving trust to people. How do you know who you can trust? You said you had a friend who asked about you? Well think about what's in it for him? It seems to me like probably not much, except that he cares about you and wants to make sure you're okay. If you ask yourself what's in it for the other person it can ease your mind a little bit that they don't have an ulterior motive. If you're not sure, then proceed with caution, until you have time to learn more about them. I know that was long winded but I hope it helps.","Then one day it dawned on me, and I can't tell you when exactly, but it occurred to me that it's okay not to be perfect, and to remind myself that nobody is, and in accepting that I wasn't perfect and that it was okay, I could stop hating myself.",1246,6,1

I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem. I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault. I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that? Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel ""Sad"" because im a young teenager with hormones in me. But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread. Sorry for the rant I just feel I really need to talk about this. Any responses would mean the world to me.","I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore.",2184,6,1

s_1160_103,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Disorganised Attachment looking for advice Hi so I guess I'm just asking for advice here. I'm a high school student who just found out I'm FA yesterday. I thought I was DA but when I actually toon a test and got FA it seemed like everything just makes sense. My problem- which probably every FA face - is I'm lacking intimacy with people. I can't open up, or can't trust, any human being on this world (sounds exaggerated but that's the case?) Everyone that tried to be nice to me looks fake and they probably just want to gain stuff from it. I know this is irrational and I persuaded myself but I still can't get rid of those thoughts. Detailed examples: - my therapist. As I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I take medications and I visit my therapist regularly. It's my third therapist but I still can't trust her. It's her job, and she's just doing it for money. Also, she will tell my condition to my parents if I open up, and I don't want my parents to know more about me. So because of this problem, I haven't been opening up anything about relationships to my therapist and psychiatrist. - friendships. I CRAVE for friends. But none of them gives me unconditional love. I know, it's in order to fulfill my need from childhood and to make them act as my parents bla bla but I don't know what to do with it. I can't trust them, I feel like their kindness is all fake. Although that..I really feel like I need someone I can trust behind my back. It feels really lonely and isolating being cautious towards everyone. - parents No I don't want intimacy with them. It feels strange to be close to them. My dad is problematic. My mom is nice but i still don't want to get close to her. They only are my source of money and shelter right now and I will get out of the house asap. After that, I might not even contact them anymore. Being FA makes me feel like I did something wrong. Especially when on the Internet so many people are blaming FA for causing issues. I always feel like I'm not doing good enough and it's really frustrating cuz I actually am trying. I guess I'm just hoping someone will reply for now:/ Also, sorry for my weird grammar and poor vocabulary.",I always feel like I'm not doing good enough and it's really frustrating cuz I actually am trying.,1972,6,1

s_655_6,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I just realized my pay was wrong for most of 2018, what can I do? Ok, I live in Columbia, South Carolina. I work for a nursing agency that places me at different facilities to work. But for the last two years I've worked at one place exclusively. The company that owns the facility I'm currently working at owns many facilities. Last year they renegotiated their contract with my agency which caused me to receive a $5 an hour pay raise. Shortly after that I started to get cancelled a lot. The facility that I was working at said the pay raise made me non competitive with other agencies in the area (they could get a different nurse for less). My agency has always been great. They did not want me to have to give back a 5 dollar raise so the agreement was that THEY would go back to the original rate for billing. But that I would only be giving back 2 dollars per hour and that I would keep 3. I made a huge mistake here, I know the mistake and can't go back and not make it. But I never went to our paychex site to verify the rate of pay. The site is not associated with our regular site and my checks always seemed right. It was stupid and I can't believe I did that but last week a computer error shorted me one of my days. They paid me for that day with this weeks check, but it still didn't seem right. So I had to call my agency to get my login info for paychex to go in and verify it. And when I went to check to see if I got paid for the day I was missing I realized something much worse. My pay rate was off by 2 dollars. As soon as I saw it I already knew but I started going through and sure enough I've been paid 2 dollars an hour less than what my rate is supposed to be since 2.16.18. EDIT 1: I just totalled up the hours and I was shorted 2 dollars for 1890 hrs. Which means I'm owed 3780 minus taxes. I contacted my agency and notified my branch manager and she did agree that the rate was wrong and she said that they would fix it. But how likely are they to backpay for all of those hours? It's so embarrassing to realize this big of a mistake. EDIT 2: Ok, now I have a problem. I just spoke with a person at the corporate office who is also the person that notified me when I was going to have my pay reduced by 2 dollars (after the 5 dollar raise). They say that a week later they called me again and notified me that they misquoted the rate to me and that it was a 4 dollar reduction. I 100% DO NOT REMEMBER ANY SUCH CALL. And I am very sure that I would remember something like that. But seeing as I'm stupid and didn't bother to check the paystubs and since her documentation shows otherwise I can't see how I'd get this corrected. I'm so depressed. I know I'm getting screwed here and there isn't a thing I can do. I told her that i want the pay increased by 2 dollars effective today or I'm going to leave the company. I'm waiting to hear back on that. Bummer for me I guess.",I'm so depressed.,2659,0,1

Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis.

Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life...
I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now. I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you.","I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.",1675,0,1

I remember being 8 and thinking I'd never be able to die. Now all I've been able to think of for 6 months is dying, how that day is coming soon, and how I want to die in my sleep. I have a bucket list of things that will never benefit me. One of those things is doable, I think. I want to have my baby boy, who is due next month. But what happens when I'm supposed to die within the next 3-4 months? I just leave him with my fiance? I want to get married... but I don't know if I'll be able to do that anymore. What am I supposed to do with the body in which I live? Where am I going when I die? Where am I going to die? These are questions that go through my head constantly, every single day of my fucking pitiful life. I don't want to die at the age of 21. I honestly which I could afford to be preserved through cryonics and live life again one day... but I don't want to go through the pain of dying. I don't know what's waiting for me on the other end. Just... fuck. Fuck cancer. Fuck my life. Fuck everything (except Reddit - Reddit's been my anchor ever since I was diagnosed). I shall now go wallow in self-pity for the rest of the night and wish I was never born or someone would shoot me while I was unsuspecting. EDIT: I don't know why I made this post. If you guys want to, you can ask me absolutely anything you want about my situation, and if you have any... I don't know... 'advice'... I'll listen. [UPDATE](<URL>) Some of you may or may not remember this. [ <URL>](<URL>) Im here to give you an update on that. I am the wife of the poster of that thread (and owner of this account) and he told me to update you on his current status. James (my husband...lol) is currently hospitalized. his Life is on its last legs and with every breath he takes he is drawn closer to his Last. its took me a few days to work up the strength to even write this. He told me he feels beautifully content and at peace and wants to get his passing over and done with just dissapointed he isn't going to be able to meet his son. i can only wish I was able to be so at peace with him leaving me... just looking at him so helpless, looking like death itself hurts me so much. I dont want him to go... that was the update, for now. any advice you guys can give us both is much appreciated and if you want to hear updates on his condition please tell me :) Edit on 1st March 2015: James passed away on the 17th February while sleeping at around 2:30AM GMT. His baby is due to be born any day now. thank you all for the kind words you have given the both of us throughout this difficult time in both of our lives reddit. **Personal note:** For me it's just so surreal that the people involved in this were real people. It makes me extremely sad and pent up with grief. OOP passed 7 years ago. He never got to live the rest of his life with his family. He never got to meet his son. These kind of stories just help me learn to cherish everything in life. The fact that this was posted 7 years ago gives me a very nostalgic feeling. I keep imagining OOP's widow and child flourishing and being happy in life. His widow must be in her mid-late 20s and their son must be 6 now. I just hope his son knows everything there is to know about his father and that James' widow and son cherish and are happy. Everybody please use a free award on the original post, perhaps we can get the widow's attention and find out about her life now. I'm sure it would also be glad that people are thinking about her husband 7 years later. The update didn't get a lot of responses as well. ** R.I.P James**",It makes me extremely sad and pent up with grief.,2919,0,1

I'm an international student and haven't registered with a GP in this country yet, because I need my medical records to do so -- medical records which I've tried to obtain before but can't work out at all because my country's health records are all decentralised, so I'd need to know who my childhood GP(s) was / were, but I aged out of foster care and don't speak to my bio parents anymore. I'm sure there must be someone who would know how to get them for me, or how to register with the GP without them, but it just feels like an insurmountable task. I'm such a failure that I can't even register for counseling properly and that just crushes me. I don't even know if what I'm experiencing right now is just some weird fucked up complex grief because my estranged brother died 18 months ago and my childhood best friend died back in February, or if this is just who I am now and my brain is actually broken. I don't know. I used to be such a high achiever, such a hard worker, used to shit out 12 hours of work straight no problem. I just want to go back to that. I want things to be how they used to be.

s_2958_177,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Existential anxiety comes and goes. Has anyone felt like this before? I've been having severe anxiety about my life for the past 2 years. Basically along the lines of how I conduct myself, how I spend my time, wether I'm living a life that is worthwhile and productive. Sometimes in the last 2 years it's been to the point that I wasn't going outside much and spent a lot of time reading. My biggest issue was that I was having a great deal of anxiety regarding the media and how it affects people. After reading books like 1984, and to a greater extent Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, I became really fixated on how the media I consume affects my mind. I know this sounds paranoid, believe me many times I've felt I was losing my mind with how anxious I was, but many, many very well respected and intelligent people have written about exactly what I'm talking about. People have written whole books in fact
ex: [<URL>]
I now get very anxious about what I read, watch, listen to, and generally participate in. I've become very aware of which popular news papers are directed at which audience and its not a very difficult thing to do. Writing style, content, advertisements are all indicative of the sort of people that the publication is being directed to. In general I feel like I'm being shoehorned into a specific consumption and that my life is full of distraction. I feel as though me and everyone around me are being distracted which prevents us from reaching our full potential. I've tried so many times to get out of this thought loop but I fail every time. I can't stop feeling anxious about it, I'm so afraid that I've wasted my life and that I'll never reach my potential because I'll always be driven to distract myself. The worst part is that every person speak to about this, college professors, my therapist, all agree that my observations have a great deal of truth to them, so I can't be completely deluded. I wish I could stop thinking about it but I can't, I wish I could go back to not thinking about what I consume and just live a life of ignorance. I don't know, does this sound as off the wall to you as it sometimes does to me? Is my anxiety founded or am I walking a thin line of falling into an even darker arena than anxiety? I don't know I just can't seem to escape these thoughts, they're so fundamental to my life and how I'm going to live.","I can't stop feeling anxious about it, I'm so afraid that I've wasted my life and that I'll never reach my potential because I'll always be driven to distract myself.",1569,0,1

s_1514_41,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"The Pledge I was skeptical when my online friends first linked me to the supposed evil Kickstarter that was going viral on the less-than-wholesome forums we frequented. We were an unmoderated haven for trolls, weirdos, and radicals, sure, but this Kickstarter was something else entirely. It seemed to have no publicly stated goal; the writers had only promised something awesome if the funding amount was reached. Stranger still, the rewards were all hidden except for the first level. In the Pledge $1 or more' box the text read: ""Want to get started? Throw in $1, and you'll receive access to the higher pledge tiers. Also, two things will happen. You will have a minor intangible wish granted, and we will send you a video of one of us kicking a random stranger! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" Tomorrow? Don't these rewards usually only get sent out after full funding? But I understood what they were going for. This was a gimmick to get attention, and judging by the high number of backers listed in the box, it was working. Screw it, I thought. I'll throw in a dollar and see what happens. As I woke up the next morning, I trudged around the kitchen making coffee and then sat sipping it at the table while trying to escape the grogginess of sleep. All I wanted was a day to myself to avoid the grinding monotony of classes. At that moment, my phone dinged. Lifting it, I saw that someone had sent me an email with a video attachment. I instantly became fully awake as I realized what this was. Opening it with trepidation, I hit play and watched. Five teenagers in black hoodies and expressionless white masks ran through an alleyway together, often looking back at the camera and laughing. When they reached the street, they made a beeline for a tired businessman on a bench, and the lead kid ran right up and kicked him in the shin. Confused and angry, the businessman leapt up and began shouting, but the hooligans were already running away. The last few seconds of the video were a close-up of a white mask and dark emotionless eyeholes as they fled the scene. The speaker said, ""This one's for you, Jason Phillips. Thanks for your dollar pledge!"" It would be an understatement to say I was put off. They were actually going around kicking people in return for a dollar! I had to call the police. I picked up my phone again, moved to action by the fear that I might be liable for thisbut my phone dinged again. I had a text message and an email from the official college department telling me that classes were cancelled today on account of a bomb threat. I sat in silence until it hit me: I'd just been wishing for a day to myself. Had these violent teenagers guessed that would be my minor wish? Had they called in a bomb threat to get me the day off? I shivered. I couldn't call the police. I couldn't be connected to this. I would be expelled at best and jailed at worst. They might even look into my history of trolling online, and then I'd really be screwed. How the hell had they gotten my name? Had I been so stupid as to use my real credit card? I flipped through the logs and confirmation emails, but noI'd taken the proper precaution and used an anonymous cash card. How had they gotten my information? My friends had to be in on it. This was all a prank! Well, they'd gotten me good. There was probably no bomb threat at all. The text had likely been faked or spoofed somehow. Smiling the whole way, I went to class anyway. But it was cancelled, and cops were everywhere. Rather than going home, I stopped in a Starbucks and pulled out my laptop. Was it paranoia to avoid using my computer at home? Something about this seemed off. Checking the Kickstarter again to try to understand what was happening, I saw that I'd been given access to the $5 tier. "" Now that you've seen we're legit, why not up the stakes a little? Pledge five bucks and we'll get you something tangible of your choice worth $500 or less. We'll also send you a video of us punching a stranger in the face! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" I could actually feel my circulatory system in my torso thanks to the stressed beats within. It was not a pleasant feeling. But pay $5 and get something worth $500? The first thing that came to mind was that gaming console I couldn't afford. All my classmates were talking about the greatest new games, but could only watch gameplay videos online to carry on the charade that I had them myself. In some sense, I believed that the Kickstarter videos were staged and that the end parts with the close-up and my spoken name were edited onto the end of each file they sent out. Reassuring myself, I pledged five bucks. I drank more than my share of beer that night with my roommates. Trying to pretend like everything was fine, I forced smiles and told some jokes. One of my friends mentioned that I seemed strained, but I laughed it off and said it was just the stress of upcoming finals. The beer helped me sleep, but I awoke with a start and ran downstairs as morning light shimmered in through the windows. There was already a package on my doorstep. It was addressed to someone named Ricardo Jimenez, along with a note that read ""Happy Birthday, son!"" I opened it, but I already knew what it was: someone else's gaming system had been diverted to my address. As I opened the box, my phone dinged, and my blood ran cold. Were they teenagers? They were thin and lanky under their black hoodies and blue jeans, but their masks hid any identifying features. Watching them run, I noticed their gait seemed odd, and I steeled myself as they burst out of a different alley and ran at a haggard mother pushing a baby carriage. I screamed at my phone, ""No!""but it was useless. The lead hooligan ran straight at her and popped her in the side of the face with a punch that took a straight line. From that, I knew they were the same height as her. I absorbed that fact to counter the horrible feeling that I'd caused this to happen to some unsuspecting mother on the street. Again, a mask filled the video view for the final sequence. "" Thanks for your five dollar pledge, Jason Phillips! I hope you enjoy those games!"" The gaming system found a new home in a dumpster five blocks away from my apartment. I couldn't keep it, not after what I'd seen, and I certainly couldn't sell it without confirming intent for any police that might be chasing these guys down. On the walk back, I took a roundabout route, and I eyed every car around me with suspicion. No one seemed to be taking note of my presence but why should they? To the real world, I was just a random college senior. They had no idea what I did or said online. Classes blurred by. I could think of nothing else but the Kickstarter. I knew I would see another new pledge level if I looked again, but I feared what I would find. Between classes, I tried to contact the friends that had linked me to it. None of them were responding. I was still half-certain they were somehow in on it, but the feeling this whole thing was giving meI just couldn't be sure anymore. My resistance lasted two days. Ostensibly, I was checking to see when the mysterious goalless Kickstarter was ending, but I couldn't help but glance down and see the $10 tier. "" You're in it now, friend! For your amazing support of ten dollars, we will free you from an intangible chain that's weighing you down. We'll also send you another of those videos you love. In this one, we'll non-fatally stab someone just for you! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" Stab someone? Jesus Christ! But an intangible chain weighing me down? God, my student loans! I hit the Pledge button without letting myself debate further. My student loan debt was over eighty-thousand dollars, and it represented a lifetime of tithing servitude that I would never fully repay, not with the way the economy was going. Wine was my friend that night rather than beer. I sat watching pirated movies online until the sun came up, not bearing to think about what I'd done. At the same time, I very much needed this to be real. When the Student Financial Services office opened, I was there. As I barged in the instant the clock hit the hour, a blonde fellow student looked up in surprise. "" Can I help you?"" ""Yes, I need to check my debt balance."" I tried my best to look calm, but I guessed my terse restraint just made me that much more suspicious. "" My name's Jason Phillips. Here's my student ID and papers."" ""Sure,"" she said, taking my paperwork and turning to her computer. After a moment of typing, she began to recite, ""If this is about a payment, you can go to our"" She stopped typing. "" Looks like you have a zero balance."" Barely able to keep myself from shaking in my sneakers, I clarified, ""No debt? It got paid off?"" She shook her head. "" You've never taken out a loan with us at all. You're enrolled, but the Registrar's database says you've paid in cash every term."" ""From what accounts?"" I asked, forcing a nonchalant smile. ""Oh, we don't have access to that here."" She gave a small laugh. "" I'm just here through work study. Is something wrong? I'd kill to be debt-free."" My phone dinged in my pocket. "" Don't say that,"" I told her far more seriously than I intended. "" Don't say that."" Out in the hallway, I sat and watched the video. The same five black-hoodied, white-masked thugs were running through an alley. As they emerged onto the street and headed for a bald teenage girl in a shirt that read 'I stood strong, I fought hard, I won', I closed the video and put it away. I couldn't watch it. I recognized that kind of shirt from my father's own struggle with cancer. The shaking wouldn't stop, and I imagined I was bright red from the absolute chaos going on inside my chest. Oh God, I was free of the debt, free of the weight of eighty-thousand dollars that had racked up when my father's illness ate my college fund. I was free of the debt and I was happy for it. I was happy! Meanwhile, some teenage girl that had just survived the unthinkable was about to be stabbed in exchange. My only consolation, as spit and tears plopped onto the floor by my sneakers, was that the pledge box had specified non-fatal. ""Are you alright?"" It was my turn to look up in surprise. ""It's not often that someone comes in freaked out and sad that they have no debt,"" the blonde girl from the front desk said. "" Something's the matter, isn't it?"" After studying my face, she sat next to me. "" I'm Kelly."" ""Jason,"" I told her, unable to look her in the eye. ""Why don't you tell me what's wrong, Jason?"" It all spilled out of me in one long babbling wave. The Kickstarter, the pledge tiers, the bomb threat, the kick, the gaming system, the punch in the face, the cancelled student loan debt; she sat and listened to all of it, wary. After I was done, she nodded once, narrowed her eyes, and then said, ""Show me the video."" That was not the reaction I'd expected. I'd been braced for disbelief or having the cops called on me. Instead, I asked, ""Are you sure? ""Just show it to me."" She took the phone and watched without visible reaction. After I heard it say my name and thank me for the ten dollar pledge, she said, ""Well, they stabbed her. But I think she'll live."" I finally found myself able to look at her. Now that someone else knew, I wasn't so gripped by terror and self-loathing. "" You're not scared?"" ""I don't know enough to be scared yet. Do you have the other two videos on this phone?"" She watched the previous two with the same calculating gaze. Once they were over, she said, ""They always originate out of sight. Why is that? And who exactly is doing the filming? Tonight, let's get these on a bigger monitor and watch for reflections. These look like random city streets. There's no way they've got all the angles coveredand if they do, you'll know it's fake."" After a sigh and a nod, I told her, ""I have a desktop computer at home. Two big monitors."" ""You a Computer Science major?"" ""Alright, here's my number. Text me your address and I'll come by after work and classes."" Taking my phone back with a sense of dumbfounded shame and hope, I asked, ""Why are you helping me?"" ""Maybe I'm one of them,"" she said with complete neutrality. "" And this is just a way of secretly getting closer to you."" I laughed nervously, but she returned to the Student Financial Services office without taking it back or even hinting that she was joking. Something about her deadpan attitude made her seem trustworthy or maybe I was just desperate to have help in this. But I had no other option anyway. That night, I sent her my address, and she showed up with a laptop of her own and sat at my desk alongside me. I loaded up the videos on my large monitors, and we began to go through them frame by frame, staring at every single blur and corner. ""Hackers of some sort,"" she guessed, drinking from a very large fountain soda she'd brought. "" You'd be surprised the kind of information they can get online."" ""Oh, I'm no stranger to hacking,"" I replied, feeling much better now that I had an ally. "" I basically live on the Internet. Career no-lifer here. But this is a whole other level. Calling in bomb threats, redirecting mail, cancelling debt, and all without any police attention that I've seen: these guys are good."" She glanced up at one of the tab names in my browser bar above the video. "" You frequent that forum?"" Red-faced, I quickly closed the tab. "" I'm not a brony, I swear. I was just trying to get info on these guys."" ""I believe you,"" she said sardonically. There was nothing in the first or second video, even going frame by frame. "" Could just be unlucky,"" she commented. "" Load up the third one."" I glanced over at my small digital clock. "" Are you sure? It's two in the morning."" ""I'm sure. There's something here."" Again, I had to ask: ""Why are you helping me?"" She looked me straight in the eyes, which I'd found was rare for her. "" It's a mystery. Don't you want to solve it?"" ""They're hurting people."" My heart was beating fast again, for many reasons. "" This is messed up. They're halfway to their fundraising goal, and I don't even know what'll happen when they reach it!"" ""Could be some sort of terrorist attack,"" she mused. "" But that doesn't seem right. These guys have some sort of moral code lurking behind their cheery shenanigans. They're giving you things, but they're also hurting people. Before we look at the third video, what's the next pledge tier?"" I opened up the Kickstarter and stared. "" You've come so far in support of our grand goal! What's a few more dollars? Pledge $25 and we'll get you something tangible that will go a long way towards your happiness and freedom. Our video offering here is also pretty kickasspun intended. With this tier, we'll send you a video of us kicking someone you know! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."" She looked to me. "" The cost in violence appears to have gone down."" ""But now it's someone I know,"" I said with hesitation. "" But what does that mean? What level of being familiar with someone means I know them? Do they mean my friends online? Classmates here?"" ""The choice is yours,"" she replied, still neutral. "" But that seems like a small price to pay for more information. A fourth video would help, along with seeing them in action again."" ""That's true."" I'd been thinking that myself. Before I could second-guess the decision, I clicked the Pledge button again. She gazed around my bedroom. "" Nothing happened."" ""Well yeah, it's not immediate."" ""Then let's go over this video."" We began going through the third video frame by frame, looking for any hint of editing or angles that might show something the five masked, lanky figures had missedand I lost all feeling in my limbs for a moment as I finally saw it. Pointing, I drew Kelly's attention to a reflection on a passing car window. Five black hoodies and white masks could be seen, but. ""There's nobody filming,"" she said with confusion. "" That's where the camera should be, right?"" I half-shouted. "" There's the pole that just passed on the left! Where's the cameraman? Where's the camera?!"" While I got up and began to pace back and forth in a panic, she sat in her chair, staring down at the desk and murmuring to herself, ""Hacking, coding, digital alterationburied for us to findthey want us to be scared. They didn't make a single mistake in the first two videos. They knew we'd comb through and find it. All part of the gimmick."" ""Yeah, yeah. That has to be it!"" ""But to edit the reflection on glass on a moving car so perfectly,"" she continued, rocking back and forth slightly. "" It's amazing."" She snapped out of it then and looked at me. "" It's too late to walk through the city. I'm staying here tonight."" Just like that, one confusing terror drained out me to be replaced by another. ""... She slept on the other side of my bed while I remained awake. I was getting increasingly fatigued, but I was far too tense to sleep for many reasons. Morning came as a gradual grey lightening, and I sat up wearily just as the sounds of a loud and heavy truck began emanating from outside my window. Kelly awoke and popped up instantly with no sign of exhaustion. Together, we went outside to see a heavy-set man operating a winch to lower a sports car onto the pavement. "" You Jason Phillips?"" ""Got some ID?"" I showed him. He grunted. "" This car's for you, kid. What'd you do, get all A's and your parents bought you a car? This one's an easy hundred-thousand. Must have been some tough classes."" Staring, I said nothing. He handed me the title after I signed something on a clipboard, and, suddenly, I was the new owner of a Lamborghini. The deliveryman knew nothing of interest, only that the order had come in online and cleared, and I was left to sit in my new sports car while my phone dinged every so often to remind me I had a new video. This didn't do it for me. I didn't care about a car. I wasn't really that material. Exceptwhat else had the tier said? Something about freedom? A car meant the ability to travel. With a car, class would no longer be a twenty minute walk away. I could give rides to people, curry favor... impress girls. I looked over at Kelly, who stood studying the title and paperwork. Did this kind of thing impact her at all? Nothing seemed to faze her. But I was not nearly as stoic. The fourth video immediately began in a dark gap between two houses, and the five white-masked perpetrators ran across the street toward a house I recognized. As they broke in the door and the sounds of my mother screaming reached my ears, I watched in abject horror as the invaders broke my dad's at-home medical machines and began brutally kicking him until he was crawling on the floor. Exact grammar was important: the first tier had said that one of them would kick a random stranger. This latest tier had simply said the video would be of 'us' kicking someone I knew. I hadn't paid close enough attention! My jaw began trembling as I watched the five run from the house, laughing. "" Jason Phillips, thanks for your continued donations!"" ""What is it?"" Kelly asked. Through the open car window, I handed her the phone in silence. She watched it calmly. "" This is great."" I screamed. "" Did you see what they did?!"" They entered a place they did not control, and by the color of the sky it looks like they literally just did this. They'll have screwed up this time. They didn't give themselves a chance to edit the video. Get inside and get this on your monitor."" Wiping away tears, I did as instructed, and we began going over the fourth video frame by frame. It was gut-wrenching to see my father beaten so brutally after what he'd already survived, and to know that I did thatit was something I could never apologize for. Kelly said, ""The Kickstarter's almost at its goal."" Glancing at my other monitor, I saw only a sliver remaining to be filled. It was me, wasn't it? It was counting down for me. I kept finding excuses to gain things at the cost of others, and I kept finding ways to feel confused or surprised about the result to shirk responsibility. It had clearly stated what would happen in each tier. In fact, while Kelly continued studying the fourth video, my eyes strayed to the fifth and final tier: ""Are you ready for the Change? Pledge the maximum amount and we'll reach our goal. Untold wonders await our most devoted supporters. We'll also send you a video of us killing someone you know! Don't worry, it won't be a family member. Estimated Delivery: Immediate!"" Untold wonders? What could that entail? They'd already done such incredible things, but they'd all been within the realm of possibility via computers and social engineering so far. Next to me, Kelly gasped. "" They missed one. They missed a reflection!"" She grasped my arm, but I just kept staring at the Pledge button. Untold wonders? "" They're not human! Jason, look! You have to look!"" My hand floated to my mouse, and I moved the pointer over the Pledge button. I had an idea of who would be sacrificed, if not a family member. Kelly seemed like a great person, strange in some ways, very caring in others, but did I really value her as highly as whatever these untold wonders were? I didn't know her that well, but yes. She was human, and she was alive, just like me. This wasn't some anonymous person on the Internet that I was slinging insults at. This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world. God, I'd been a terrible person. The stress of my father's illness and the pressure on my finances and family had pushed me in a dark direction; a direction I now had to resist. I let out a sigh and released the mouse. The spell was broken. It was over. The madness was over. ""No more,"" I said with relief. "" I can't go down this road any further. It's just not right."" I turned and froze; the ominous black maw of a gun barrel had been pointed at the back of my head, and it was now directly touching the bridge of my nose. "" She slowly withdrew the weapon and slotted it into an unseen holster. Still eerily calm, she began to walk away. ""What was all this?"" I called after her from my seat, my mind racing from the adrenaline. "" Jesus, was this a test?"" She paused at my door. Without looking back at me, she said softly, ""Yes. A test for admittanceand you failed."" Her gaze turned slowly toward me, and now that she was no longer putting on an act, I understood that her expressionlessness was that of an animated corpse. "" But I'm glad you did. You wouldn't like it where we're from."" With that, she was gone, and I was left to quiver in my chair, process what had happened, and stare at the one reflection the editors had missed in the fourth video: the face of the cameraman. It was a demonic, hollow-eyed, maggot-infested sneering visage; it was a face that would haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life. It was my facealmost. ---

s_1483_41,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"First, sorry that it took a week for me to respond. I don't necessarily think it's a good thing. And I think that a person should seek help before resorting to suicide. But ultimately I think suicide is a personal choice and it's better to be given a solution that would cause the least potential for pain. I can't imagine attempting to kill myself, failing, and being scarred or maimed by my attempt. I understand the argument that suicide isn't only about you and it effects your loved ones as well. But that's kind of an unfair argument. Take myself for example. Every day, I wake up absolutely depressed. It takes a genuine concentrated effort to even get out of my bed to go to the bathroom. I have a therapist, I go to therapy once a week. I'm medicated. All that does nothing to change the fact that I pray every night for death. The only reason I don't kill myself is for my kids. But it's such a difficult argument. I am only remotely close to happy every other weekend when they come over. So 1/7 of my life is tolerable. The rest of the time is spent literally begging for death. So, on the argument of ""don't kill yourself because it will make others sad"", why should I continue to suffer day in and day out, just so others don't have to be sad for a day or 2.

s_1483_41,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"First, sorry that it took a week for me to respond. I don't necessarily think it's a good thing. And I think that a person should seek help before resorting to suicide. But ultimately I think suicide is a personal choice and it's better to be given a solution that would cause the least potential for pain. I can't imagine attempting to kill myself, failing, and being scarred or maimed by my attempt. I understand the argument that suicide isn't only about you and it effects your loved ones as well. But that's kind of an unfair argument. Take myself for example. Every day, I wake up absolutely depressed. It takes a genuine concentrated effort to even get out of my bed to go to the bathroom. I have a therapist, I go to therapy once a week. I'm medicated. All that does nothing to change the fact that I pray every night for death. The only reason I don't kill myself is for my kids. But it's such a difficult argument. I am only remotely close to happy every other weekend when they come over. So 1/7 of my life is tolerable. The rest of the time is spent literally begging for death. So, on the argument of ""don't kill yourself because it will make others sad"", why should I continue to suffer day in and day out, just so others don't have to be sad for a day or 2.

I have some updates to that story and I would like to hear your opinions on what I should do. I waited a few weeks after my first post and I sent her a card that generally said I'm sorry for what I did, I will give you space if you want space, but I am here for you if you want me to be here. It was a very kind card (at least I think so): I didn't make any implications that she should reply or anything like that, it was very neutral and she could have done whatever she wanted with it. She then posts on her Tumblr a few things. First, she posts this:
""Im tired of this. I have already made it very clear how I feel. The rest I dont think I have any obligation to explain. I am done caring."" She then deletes it maybe an hour later (I was checking it pretty obsessively) and posts this:
""There is really nothing I have to say to you, because every time I do try to think of something to say, all that comes to me are words of anger. Thats not something Id like to do, unless maybe it is really necessary for you to understand. So now the only thing I have to say is that I think the best thing to do now is just to let go and move on. I have made my peace and I will let go of whatever anger there is remaining. I have no regrets, no blame, no guilt, and no will to even try to explain anymore. I would like to move on without even the tiniest things holding me back. Though I guess I do have one more thing. Saturday did not hurt me as much as you might think it did. So let go of whatever guilt you say you have. There is no reason to hold onto it anymore. I get pretty angry and start to vent things on my Tumblr, which I thought she didn't know about. I said some very mean, untrue things. I was just so angry and I was writing down whatever came to my mind. Turns out she DID know about my Tumblr and read everything. She sends me a very angry email saying things like ""obviously I was too nice, and you're taking advantage of that, you don't say these things to people to make you feel better about yourself."" She legitimately thought that I wrote it in the intent that I wanted her to read it. Her friends messages me too, doing general ""you're spewing nonsense, you obviously don't know my friend, grow up and leave her alone you don't deserve her"". I send her friend a message explaining that I didn't know she knew about my Tumblr and that I never intended for her to read what I wrote, and that I would leave them alone. She sends a message back thanking me and saying that what I've said means a lot (not sarcastically, I think she really meant it). Sorry for another wall of text. I don't really like leaving anything out. My question now is, do you think that I should wait this out and see what happens, or do you think the situation is wrecked and I should move on? She obviously did not want to repair this even before she read what I wrote, but I know that it hasn't even been that much time since our initial argument. I know everyone said to wait a few months, but I knew I would feel like shit until I did something proactive.

She seems to be quiet and introverted and almost never talks with any classmates, except one classmate who is her friend. I'm like this too. I almost never talk with my classmates. I'm very quiet and I only go to class for the class and to do my homework. I tried to find her but she seems to not have any social media or atleast I can't find it. I'm also very quiet because 1. I'm introverted, I have no interest in socializing 2. I'm always too tired, I have no energy for socializing 3. My social skills are bad and I have autism 4. I'm weird and socially inept and I can just feel that my classmates are uncomfortable around me. I don't really like my classmates So, she and I are both very quiet. She often sits alone and I sit alone too. I would want to have conversations with her, but in reality I never talk to her. Not before class, not during class, not after class. I don't talk to her because 1. I'm scared and unconfident 2. I feel like she wants to be left alone since she always sits alone 3. I'm probably gonna mess up anyways because im ugly and socially inept and weird 4. I don't know if she is taken or single, how can I find out? I do not want to immediately date her, I only want to get to know her but I don't know how. If I suddenly start sitting next to her during classes and talking to her, she might get uncomfortable and not want it, I don't know if this is even an appropriate thing to do and probably my whole class will think i'm a creep since normally I don't talk to anyone in the class, so if I suddenly start being social but only with this one girl, its gonna give weird signs to my classmates? I feel so hopeless about this situation. How can I find out if she is single? How can I talk / get to know her without anyone thinking I'm a weirdo since I normally dont talk to anyone? How can I make sure she is not uncomfortable if I talk to her, or sit next to her? How can I get to know her without getting friendzoned? I have no idea how flirting works and even if I learned the theory of it I would be super bad at it due to my autism and bad social skills.

I wanted to try and work things out but she was not at all interested.

I was already in a depressed state and this did not help things along. I ended up checking myself into a hospital for most of February.

I dont know if I can take much more of this guys. My wife and my two beautiful kids were everything to me, and so far they show no promise of returning. Everyday it gets harder and harder to continue this, and the events that are taking place arent helping. The past two days have added nothing but more confusion, and I want it to stop. Let me start a little bit after my last post. I decided to go to a local bar and drown my fresh sorrows in some alcohol. Not the best choice of coping, I know, but I just needed to take my mind off things. I stayed at the bar until 9PM (I was only there for a couple hours) before they closed and kicked me out. Too drunk to drive home, I decided to call an Uber. For those who are unfamiliar with Uber, it is a taxi service where everyday people are the cabbies, and they use their personal cars. In my smaller town, its usually the same 3 drivers. However, the one who picked me up was new. She was this pretty brown-haired girl, boasting a tight blue-dress. She was chatty, but I honestly didnt feel like talking. She told me it was her first day (which was weird, usually drivers receive training on their first few days of work), asked me how my night was, the typical small-talk questions. However, she told me something I will never forget. Something that still sends chills down my spine. As she pulled up in front of my house, I exited the car. I started to walk away, when I heard her window roll down. I assumed that maybe the payment didnt come through, or something malfunctioned, so I turned around and faced her. She smiled at me and said I hope you find them! Before I could respond she laughed and sped away. She turned the corner before I could get her license plate number. What the fuck does she know about this? She has to know something, why else would she say something like that? Was this some sort of sick, elaborate joke? I got home and tried to put it out if my mind. Despite it only being 9:15PM, I decided to go to bed. I didnt sleep much. That woman was all I could think about. Who was she? How much did she know? I had no way to be sure. All I know is that this just ruined me. Instead of being sad, now I was just angry. I passed out about an hour later. I was startled awake by a call from No Caller ID. Ive always had sleeping problems (now more than ever) so I knew I wouldnt get back to sleep for another few hours. Expecting some night shift salesman, I answered. However, what the female speaker on the phone said was much worse. I hope you find them. I was angry, no I was furious. WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?! I screamed into the phone. She hung up, and I threw my phone against the wall, and shattered it. That was two nights ago. I awoke the next morning with a sharp headache from the heavy drinking from the night previous. I just sat up in my bed, and stared for a little while. I didnt want to get up. I didnt want to leave my bedroom and find my wife not in the living room with her exfoliative face mask on, pretending to be an alien and chasing Attis and Myla around the room. After a few minutes of staring and shedding a few tears I got up and went to make myself coffee. I sat down and decided to take my mind off things by watching the news. My now old-fashioned landline began ringing in the kitchen. The automated voice began to read off the caller ID Call from: I hope you find them. I got up and bolted into the kitchen. No number was present under the caller ID, even though it usually was. I picked up the phone, my heart sank and tears began to stream down my cheeks. There wasnt another human on the line, but an automated message. An automated message of a conversation between me and my wife. It was when my wife told me she was pregnant with Myla (my first child). I couldnt listen to the whole thing. Hearing my wifes voice just hurt too much. I just sat there on the kitchen floor and shuddered; tears welled in my eyes. There were so many questions running through my head. How did they get this recording? What kind of sick person would call me and play this? I assumed it was the female Uber driver from the night before. I just decided to leave again. I couldnt stay in that house. I couldnt stay in a house I no longer felt safe in. I drove to a nearby hotel, and decided to stay there. I brought my laptop and conducted some research. I searched through every social media site and online phonebook possible. I even called the university Christina graduated from. No one had records of her existing. Not only that, but her family didnt exist either. I looked up their social media accounts and found nothing. I spent the rest of the day watching TV and working out at the gym in the hotel, doing anything I could to not concentrate on my situation. I stopped by the local liquor store and bought two twelve-packs of beer to keep me company, and to wash away the damaged emotions I have. That was last night. I dont know why this is happening to me. What the hell did I do to deserve this? Why is this mystery girl tormenting me? I dont know what to do. I just want this to end. I just want my family back.

Something sets me off, sometimes something as simple as an imagined sleight in my mind, and I just want to lash out. It's unfortunate when we do lash out, because then we end up hurting ourselves, or worse, the people who care about us. Sounds to me like you and your grandfather were close? Because it sounds to me like his passing had a dramatic effect on you - which death, especially the death of a family member, can and will effect you. Especially if that person is close. I recently lost my aunt to pancreatic cancer - about 3 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. It was quick, it was vicious - and it was painful. When I found out she passed, I cried. I cried hard. Her and I hadn't been that close in the past few years (mainly because of distance, living in a different state), but I remember going to her place a few times every summer when I was little. So, when she passed, all those good memories flooded my mind, and I fell apart. I got depressed. I spiraled out, and just got angry for a short time at the universe - because how could it be so cruel as to take her from my family so quickly, and with such little warning.

My productivity has been going downhill and I might not make it this year in university. I crave to enjoy something, which is why I get distracted off working hard.","But now that I'm still unable to enjoy anything, I'm growing tired of life.",258,1,1

I've found most of those things, and now I am a father, and all my fears are for my children now. It's the most rewarding and most terrifying thing ever.",Not finding happiness in my life.,95,0,1
s_2625_97,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I want to become more organized but to-do lists stress me out. So I have issues with getting things done, and putting tasks off definitely makes me more depressed, yet I can't bring myself to actually do them. I feel this weird euphoria when I PLAN on doing something and then DON'T do it. Then over the next few days I feel horribly guilty, and to get over that I put off more tasks to feel better, and so on and so forth, and I remain pretty depressed. What can I do to slowly become more organized? I want to train my brain to feel good after completing tasks, but generally the pay off isn't as strong when I complete things like homework or updating my resume or cleaning my house. I also really want to be one of those people who loves to-do lists and can write a manageable to-do list and actually stick to it. I basically just build up the task so much - i.e. I need to clean my apartment. I know I need to do it, but I think, whatever, it's clean enough, and I put it off. Then it gets worse, and I start feeling guilty, but I tell myself it's fine. It keeps getting worse, and I stubbornly refuse to clean it at this point. I tell myself, ""I'm going to do this when I feel like it,"" and I never do. Then it's so awful the guilt basically consumes me and it takes me practically 5 hours to clean my place and afterwards I despise cleaning so much that I let it get to that state continuously. It's just exhausting, and it is definitely allowing my depression to continue. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!!","Then it gets worse, and I start feeling guilty, but I tell myself it's fine.",982,6,1
