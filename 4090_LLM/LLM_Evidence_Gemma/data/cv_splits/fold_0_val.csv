s_1270_9,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Im not sleeping and my stomach hurts I recently diagnosed myself with adhd, c-ptsd and possibly ASD with extreme executive dysfunction. Ever since running away from insane abusive parents, I was living alone, and I wasnt even able to feed myself on my own. If not for deliveries, I would be long dead. I hate delivery food so much. This has been going on for two years, and my health became worse. I remember after running off, I was lying in the middle of the room for weeks, in complete horror and not being able to move. Eventually I was able to stall everything. My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights. For the past week my stomach has been very bad. I guess that skipping breakfast for two years does have consequences. I had two months when I was able to fix my sleep, but now I cant fall asleep until sunrise again. Every new panic attack is more suicidal that previous. I so many plans for many human lifetimes and I dont want to die, but Im suffering way too much. Much more that a human body was made to withstand. Funny enough my adhd so far has prevented me from focusing on self harm, but it doesnt last forever.","My sleep schedule was non existent, I was sleeping days and playing games or watching anime during nights.",567,3,1

Hopefully your depression is short lived and your brain will heal its pathways soon. Ive read on here that a lot of ppl seem to struggle for about 3 months. But everyone is different. Have you tried some light exercise, like taking walks out in the sun and fresh air? Exercise is supposedly just as effective as antidepressants! Some ppl really need the meds too though. I have started walking and Ive improved my diet. That definitely makes me feel better. Maybe try that and be patient with yourself.

He was diagnosed 1 month ago and given anti-depressants after feeling low for a few months (which has been happening now and then for four years but he has never been to the doctors). When he was diagnosed he told me he needed space to sort his head out and for me to not talk to him for a few weeks, no-contact. I obliged and after 1 week he said he didn't like the thought of me being upset and it was all he could focus on so we decided to start texting again and he came and saw me, but he said he didn't know if he wanted to see me again for a while. I then saw him that weekend for about two hours, and have seen him once a week since then usually for a night and a few hours the next day. He actually seems completely normal and happy when I have seen him which is nice, we laugh like we always do. Good things are happening with his job and he is doing really well and has applied for a promotion. I am not seeing him throughout the week, and he has not come round to see my family in months - I have gone to see his. He has forgotten our anniversary and I gave him a card but he didn't get me one or offer to pay for the dinner we reluctantly went out for (something he would usually offer on our anniversary). He has been going on nights out with his friends. I feel constantly on edge and nervous he's going to stop speaking to me or going to decide he can't see me. I think I'm having a hard time thinking that the depression has caused the way he has been acting because when I see him he is normal and excited about his job and just not different. We haven't had sex for about 7 weeks because of the depression and now the anti-depressants have taken away his sex-drive.

s_1175_1278,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"It's been awhile /r/depression, I just need to thank you guys for giving me that push. ( So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks! It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time. This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.
I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. * Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*
So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.) When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, ""Well duh stupid emo"" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever. The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, ""No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again."" I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad. The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, ""Always be happy"" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. ( Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss! Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends. Over April she began talking to [this] (<URL>) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same. I think I have to make a continued post sorry. Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post.

I've had a hard time following through on projects, could not focus in school or do homework, even tho I was bright enough and had a lot of sexual issues as well. Last summer/fall I got a major depression. The worst I ever had. I never took medication for my depressions, as a friend of mine took bad antidepressants and got all fucked, so that scared me. But this time I was SO miserable, that I just wanted it to be fixed and after struggling with our mental healthcare system (I live in Denmark) for months and being send around to new psychiatrists who needed to interview me for 1-2 hours from scratch each time and then decide I was not their field, I finally got to an amazing psychiatrist. I asked all the others, if I could possibly be diagnosed with ADHD, but they all specialized in depression and send me around. I did not even ask my psychiatrist about it, she just said that I might have ADHD and we needed to look into that and then I got my diagnosis and started drugs. The drugs changed my life. One brand made me extremely nauseous, but the ones I have now only have a few side effects (I do not have a lot of appetite and used to be eating and snacking ALL THE TIME, so this thing with eating when not hungry and remembering to eat is a bit of a challenge, but it is working out now). But I do have a much easier time focusing. Both on smaller tasks at hand, like reading an e-mail or making coffee without burning myself, but also on organizing my stuff, cleaning and my job. I also feel calmer and fresher at the same time, which make social events and being around my partner much easier and I feel more connected to my body and more present, which makes it easier for me to be the person I want to be. Both in terms of job and social/romantic realtionships. I also sleep better and are much less anxious. I still have a bit of ADHD symptoms of course, but I fell much less embarrassed and in control of myself and my diagnosis have also learned me to cope with it mentally. To give myself permission to be different and not aim to do everything perfect all the time. I am working on the stuff, I want to change (like talking a lot), but also accepting that it is a part of me and that I have to live with that I don't use my diagnosis as an excuse, but as a reason. I'm not perfect and that is okay. I try my best and don't always succeed, but I do try my best, and that is the best I can do. I also try to explain, what I am experiencing to my friends, partner and family, so they can understand better, that when I ex talk for one hour about something completely boring and they tell me something important and I don't listen, it is not because I feel more important than them or do not have any interest in them they just need to tell me; ""Now I want to say something important"" and I'll focus on listening. And I am aware, that this is something I do and I work to change it, but beating myself up about it all the time, even tho I hate it, just gives me anxiety and makes it even harder to control myself. I also feel much less overwhelmed/fussy/like my head is melting after having to focus or meet people. I sleep better at night. I feel better about myself and have more energy to change or do stuff in my life, to make it better applying for a challenging, but interesting job or just organising my clothes, so it is easier to find what I need. And I am in a healthy relationship, where I am not being a childish bitch or being exploited or dependent. I just feel happy, calm and WORTHY. I've never felt worthy before and I have dated TRASH, that was definitely less worthy than I... I would like to end by saying, that my meds stopped working hours ago, as I had an early morning and here it is now late night. So while writing this I am both tired and my ADHD is full-blown active, which might be why I wrote so much and almost don't remember what I wrote. Sorry about that. But yeah, the diagnosis and the meds DEFINATELY changed my life for the better. And I've only been taking them for half a year, but that half year has been the best ever. I feel so much in control of myself and my destiny or at least in control of accepting the stuff and can't control.","I just feel happy, calm and WORTHY.",3923,0,1

Maybe some one else went through some of the same things as I did. Maybe you're going through it now. I started smoking weed at 16, I was a musician so it felt natural. I preferred cigarettes and alcohol, so I never got too sucked in. I crushed on most of the guys I smoked with, they made me feel a false sense of validation. I stopped briefly, and by the time I got to college, I fell in love with mary jane again. Or at least the people passing me the blunt. One day a friend told me, ""Hey man, you know you need to buy a sack at some point, right?"" It hit me like a light from heaven; holy shit, I can buy weed. Again, and again, and again. I couldn't afford college after another year, being out of state, and too depressed to work, so I left. Shit got worse. I smoked all day, every day. Medical grade, all the time. I went in and out of programs and rehabs, mostly because I liked the alcohol, weed, pill combos. Years went by. I was moving at a snail's pace. I ended up moving on a whim to another state, and ended up in a shitty relationship in a shitty apartment. Fuck, the weed there wasn't even that great. But I put my game face on, and bought frequently from H dealers. Never any hard stuff. I had an epiphany after I had some money stolen. I invited a bunch of friends over (fitting). We popped pills. And I cried. I cried because I lost not only my money, but because I lost myself. I called 911 on myself, went to a hospital, and left after 3 days. 23, in the middle of a new state, and trying to stay sober, was insane. I couldn't sleep most nights. I stopped drinking caffeine. I was desperate for friends. My boyfriend and I fought constantly. But I kept my goal in mind, just fucking stay sober. I had the insight to leave the state, and plan my next move. I found a town I liked, with a career program I liked, and moved on in. Still fresh in my absence from weed, I was still overly talkative and couldn't find enough ways to spend my time. Unemployed. I made friends were I could, kept looking for a job, and prayed. I prayed all the time. Sometimes with other people, mostly by myself. Some people find it weird for an LGBT man to be spiritual, but fuck, that's all I had going. My family slowly starting respecting me again. I got phone calls from people that cared. I was moving forward, and people took notice. Finally, after all the job searching, I got a job I loved. Soon, a new car. Soon after that, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend, and I was dating normal people again. Things still affect me, but I have the emotional willpower to handle them like an adult. Life isn't so much a roller coaster, more so a stroll over the sand dunes at a beach. Every moment more beautiful than the last, even if I can't see the ocean from my point of view.

s_2180_5,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Vent Post: Process of Looking for Apartments/Moving Out, Fear, Doubts, Setbacks, ""Good Faith Deposits,"" Intuition vs. Paranoia I have another vent, been stressing, doing research all night and didn't get any sleep (not that I am tired). Quick Background:
- Horrible Soul crushing living situation that brings me pain/fear all the time. - Unemployed but have savings to last a couple of months if I find a place. Not looking for a job until I find and have a stable place. - Been looking for sublet Craigslist apartments for months on months, as far back as March/April. It's been so long because I haven't been full-time/all the time. I've also been looking for sublets (between 2-6 months), somewhere I can clear my head, collect myself, get a job, save money, and eventually find more stable/longer term place. Lastly it's taken so long mostly because of fear/anxiety. Just looking at Craigslist housing posts used to cause stomach-aches. It still does but less and I know that I need to get out/have my own space. My situation:
I found a place on Craigslist a week ago. I spoke to someone and went to see the place on Tuesday. There were 2 other people looking for the place too. BTW that took strength, I was soo afraid. My stomach hurt and I was nervous. Thank God my mom was there in case I had a panic attack. Anyway I like the place and I want it. The leasing manager/who is also an individual broker said if I want to continue forward with the process I have to do an application online. She emailed me the instructions and the application link. I filled out the application and submitted the required documents (I did everything online the same night). BUT THERE IS A CATCH. I must send a $500 deposit/closing fee to hold the apartment. In turn she will take it off the market. If I am approved then we will continue the process. I am assuming that means (getting/signing a lease). If I am not approved she will return the deposit back to me. Keep in mind that I haven't been approved, haven't seen or signed a lease, and I haven't met the landlords/homeowners. Even so, I have am having serious fear, doubts about this ""Good Faith Deposit"" process. I am afraid as soon as I put in the deposit she is going to run off with my money and I won't have any way of tracking her. As I already said I am unemployed but I do have savings and good credit. I have enough savings to last the whole 6 months of the leasing term. Even so, I am not loose or risky with my money. My family has always been struggling with money my entire life and I don't want to make mistakes and do stupid things with my hard earned money. I also have a cautious/plan everything nature. I did mad research. I looked up her name on the state department, I looked up the landlord/house owners property records. Everything seems legit. I looked up housing policies and it isn't unusual or illegal to do ask people for a holding or ""Good Faith Deposit"" before getting approved, looking at and signing a lease and meeting the landlords/property owners. I really don't want to be duped. I can't afford to fall for a scam. I really don't want this to be a scam. $500 is a lot to lose for someone who doesn't have a job, and has hang ups about spending money. I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it. Right now I am waiting to hear back from the leasing manager. I sent her an email with a bunch of questions (such as asking for an electric copy of the lease and getting this ""Good Faith Deposit"" thing in writing with signatures) and I may meet up with her to see the place again later on today. In the meantime while waiting I am freaking out. I don't want to lose out on this place but I also don't want to be scammed/made a fool of. All this fear makes me question if this is my intuition talking or my paranoia. Part me wants to just pay the deposit and see what happens and the other part is like no bitch (like what if I get stuck in a bad leasing situation). Like what should I do? How can I assure myself? How can I have faith?",I can't even buy things I want without feeling guilty about it.,3232,6,1

I hate myself. I hate everything. You annoy me. Happy people annoy me. I just want to see you suffer. Yes, my so-called best friend, my so-called loved ones, my so-called girlfriend, and my readers. I want everyone to suffer. I wasnt like this before. I remember I was such a lovely, innocent and cute kid. I had a fragile body but I had a kind soul and a heart of gold. My dad was an alcoholic. I thought he was a nice guy because he used to say so. I believed him. After all, he was my dad. It didnt bother me he stopped working so that he could spend all day with his love- alcohol and drugs. What bothered me was the fact that after getting drunk he used to beat my mom. I and my brother would intervene but only to face his wrath. Studying became difficult because locking doors, being a prisoner in your own home is difficult. Constant yelling and fighting becomes the cherry on top and there goes your mind in a spiral of negative thoughts. This went on for years. Day by day it became difficult to put a smile on my face and pretend everything was normal. I lived in a good area. Everyone is middle/upper middle class here. In 12th grade, it was the first time I had the urge to see everyone suffer. To see what it feels to suffer. Theyd then develop empathy and compassion. Yes, I wanted to see them suffer. I noticed I started envying my best friend when one day he showed me the DSLR camera that he had bought. I wanted one so badly but due to being poor I couldnt even afford it in my dreams. I was annoyed. I felt guilty but the feeling of envy was too strong. I decided to go to his home later that day. I told him wed chill and watch movies. I arrived at 4:00 PM at his house. I rang the door bell and we went to his room. We decided to watch Conjuring because I love horror. Before we started the movie I asked him to grab some snacks. He went to his kitchen and I thought this was the moment. I reached to the stool on which his camera was resting. I grabbed it and threw it out the window next to me. My friend asked what was that sound? I told him I dont know. I turned off the lights and rationalized to him that true fun of horror is in the dark. After the movie finished I came back home. Next day, he told me he cant find his camera anywhere. I acted concerned but deep down I was ecstatic. Seeing him sad made me happy. I slowly started envying when I saw people having fun and posting pictures on Facebook. I needed to see someone suffer. I met my girlfriend and she told me she will be playing guitar in a local competition and I had to be there. I always wanted to play guitar but I never had a knack of it. I was jealous of her talent. She was looking forward to the competition. A day before the competition I went over to her house. I thought about pulling a string of her guitar but knew she could find a replacement of that. I needed something more permanent. I took a needle and started playfully scare her. I made it seem look like an accident and managed to stab her left index finger. She started screaming and crying. She was bleeding a lot. I brought some chilled water to wash the blood and later band-aided her finger. It all seemed like a prank gone wrong and that I didnt do it deliberately. She forgave me but was dejected because no way she could perform next morning because she couldnt even play the chords properly with her injured finger. I felt amazing. I acted as if I was sorry and I gave her a passionate kiss. She was still dejected because she was so excited to play at the competition. I felt ecstatic once again. Deep down I was thrilled and seeing her sad made me happy. So now Im writing this as I crave that ecstatic feeling once again. Are you enjoying reading stories here?

s_1900_175,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 2 So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. * I have to find my family!* One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units. According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you! ----------------
**UPDATE**
So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time. When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late. ----------
**FINAL UPDATE**
So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and ""earn my dinner"". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. * Where's my baby? Is she ok?* She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in. [](<URL>)",I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time.,8814,0,1

I'm recovering from my SECOND stress induced cardiomyopathy in the relationship with the person I love most in this world from the heartbreak. It's a type of heart attack brought in by sudden severe emotional trauma. My heart is probably malformed for life. I'm still at risk for cardiac arrest. I have NAS(NarcissisticAbuseSyndrome), severe depression with CONSTANT suicidal ideation...I've attempted suicide 4 times, actually being successful on the second but lived ultimately, and that's where I had a near/post death experience that will shape the rest of my life, for however long that may be. I'm now diagnosed with CPTSD and generalized anxiety disorder as well. I lost 44 lbs in 4 months. People with BPD are VERY COMMONLY misdiagnosed and treated(with catastrophic consequences) as ""Bipolar"".

I have so much pressure on me to be something, to be the only person in my family to never get arrested, go to college, get a good job, make good money, etc. I used to be a star student and that was where I got my self worth. now, my grades are falling and so is my self worth. I feel like if I'm not my family's trophy child then there is no reason to be their child at all, that I'm just a disappointment. My mom made me go to a psychiatrist because of it. After practically interrogating me for a few hours, they got to the touchy subject I hate talking about- rape. I was raped as a child repeatedly by a cousin not too much older than me. Honestly, being raped didn't make me feel mad at him, I feel mad at myself for not saying no. I feel mad at myself for not stopping him. I feel mad at myself for not screaming at the top of my lungs. I feel... Used. Anyways, I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and Clinical Depression. They thought that the best thing to do for m was prescribe me an antidepressant. It worked amazingly at first, but after a while,I began to feel like a zombie. As if I was an empty shell. As if I had no control over my mind. I take the pill sporadically, but for the most part, I don't. Honestly, at this point, I feel like my life is going nowhere, and that theres no point in trying anymore. I was never pretty, I was never talented, hell, I'm not even a virgin and I'm 13, but I was smart and going places. Now... Now I'm just nothing. Why do I feel so lost? Why do I feel like such a failure? Should I go back on my medication?",They thought that the best thing to do for m was prescribe me an antidepressant.,1915,9,1
s_1351_95,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Fwiw im on an ssri. It took a little finagling to find the right dosage, but I have not experienced any weight gain as a result of it (i did gain weight due to a traumatic pregnancy, but that wasnt the Lexapro's fault). As for sex -- my libido went up once on it bc I cant fuck if I'm all anxious and having panic attacks. Some folk say they feel numb on them. For me, that only happens if the dose is too high. For a few of my friends, they needed to try a few different SSRIs to get one that worked for them. Full disclosure, I did experience a few side effects when I first started: weird ass dreams, insomnia, a headache, and I felt a little tipsy. They all went away within a week. After pregnancy, I developed pmdd amd now I up and lower my dosage according to my cycle. If I miscalculate and take too high a dose, I will be a little numb but it only lasts 24 hrs. And occasionally I get the weird dreams and insomnia when I come down again. But they only last a day or so. That's something to keep in mind -- it's out of your system very quickly. So, if you dont like it, you can get off it without much difficulty. They say it can take up to a month to feel the full effect, but I noticed it within a week. I was really nervous to go on them, but to say they were life altering would feel like an understatement.

This was the first story I ever posted to Reddit. September 1, 2013. ---
Looking back, I wonder if I was crazy before I even left. That was four days ago, when I loaded into my Volkswagen Rabbit and headed into the New Mexico desert for the night. To think... At that point I would have done anything to just run away. That car had never been a real winner. I bought it off a kid from my high school as he left for college. It was a washed out silver/blue piece of shit that he'd spray painted a skull and crossbones onto the front. And to top it off, I knew fuck all about cars. So when it broke down about 4 hours from the last time I saw a paved road and started pissing oil and billowing steam from the engine, I was helpless. I checked my phone, standing on top of the car and just saw one middle finger of a signal bar pop up before the battery died and the screen went black. I was silently furious. Furious with myself for pushing the limits of how far I could get out into the blank desert. Furious with my mom for getting arrested and making me have to move out here to New Mexico with my dad in the first place. The sun started to go down, and I started walking. I couldn't follow the rabbit's tracks because I knew there was nothing at all back that way. So I picked a direction perpendicular to them, South I guess, and started walking. I wasn't really sure how worried I should have been at that point. I just figured that I'd have to find something. I should have been a lot more concerned. I walked as far as I could that first night. Without the sun it got cold and harder to maintain my direction. I walked for hours. Sometimes humming songs to myself, sometimes yelling for help, sometimes yelling curses at my parents. After a while though, I just walked. I slept that morning until the heat and the light woke me up, then started walking again. All I remember is walking, walking on with my eyes closed against the harsh white brightness of the desert. When the darkness came again I sat and rested my legs. My mind was blank and numb from the day. Burned away from the sun. I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired. In the middle of the night I started walking again. I had to get out. Another day like that could kill me. I started hearing things in the darkness. Scuffles of animals moving, following me. Waiting for me to drop dead. It was only a few eternities into the next day when I saw a building in the shimmering distance. A cry of relief passed my cracked lips as it came into focus. I knocked until my knuckles stung, cracked and bled on that fucking shed. There was no one there. There was no evidence of anyone being there. Not even a dirt road or indentions of tires worn into the desert. It was just a corrugated metal shed that had sprung up out of the desert. At noon, the sliver of shade on the side of the shed went away. I hung my head and started walking again. More hours. More nothing. The sun was settling onto the horizon. Suddenly, screams pierced the evening air - some kind of horrible monster in the distance. My legs didn't respond when I commanded them to run. It was all I could do to turn and shuffle away from the screams. The sound was loud and inhuman. I looked back and saw dust being kicked up in a cloud headed straight for me. A growling, snarling noise joined the ear-splitting screams. Then, nothing. I looked back to see a great white beast crouched and ready to pounce, the dust settling around it. I stumbled and fell onto my back. And for a moment I admired the reds and oranges of the sunset. A Tequila Sunrise spilt over the vast open canvas of the sky. Onto that canvas, a woman's head and shoulders appeared. In the low light, her skin appeared blue. Her face held a look of blank, serious determination. The same look that had been melted onto my face. A fellow wanderer. I felt calm. Then after a small movement, she held a knife, and all calm that I had felt was replaced with animal fear. The realization that the beast was still there, a few yards behind her, and that she was somehow a part of that beast. A monster to be feared. There to end my long march at last. She didn't end me there in the desert under that fiery sunset. Instead, she brought me back into the world that I sought to escape; brought me here to the hospital in the belly of what a fevered mind saw as a great white beast. Who is she? She is the one who saved me.","I remember crying a lot, but I don't remember feeling anything but tired.",2199,0,1

s_1965_10,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"Adderall potentiates benadryl tripping?! Had a really wierd experience today that doesn't make much sense. This is also essentially a trip report. For reference, I'm 22, 103lbs (mild degenerative disorder), I have tried many different drugs; and as a general rule substances do tend to effect me strongly. So last night I took 30mgs of adderall while hanging out with a buddy. Was intense, but I still had a good time. Anyway few hours later I am starting to come down and I really want to get sleep before work today so I take 50mgs of benadryl. JUST 50mg, two standard doses. Occasionally I've taken 25/50mg to get to sleep at night but I've definitely never experienced anything on it before other than getting drowsy...so, like twenty minutes later I'm getting in bed, and I turn on this white noise ten hour youtube video I sometimes use to help me sleep. I lay there for a while, before noticing that I'm hearing strange noises in the video that I haven't heard in it before. Mechanical noises. What sounds like garbled voices. Wondering what the fuck is up with my ears, I turn the light on, intending to see if I still hear it after moving around for a moment. That's when I notice mild but obvious kaleidoscope visuals on my walls. So I lay back down with the light on, and for maybe ten, fifteen minutes I am watching the patterns trying to figure out how the fuck I have psychedelic kaleidoscopes out of nowhere; while only on an adderall comedown. And then; I saw the first translucent spider moving inside the wall. I immediately made the connection that it had to somehow have been the benadryl - even though I've never tried to trip dph before I follow a lot of drug subreddits and know about it from there, and I have a friend who has done it, 700+ club and all; and he's described the experience/visuals in detail to me. So now I'm laying there wondering how a dose of benadryl that has never effected me beyond making me drowsy before, is suddenly making me see and hear things. The only different variable from taking it in the past was now I had adderal in my system. I've researched pharmacology about both of them this afternoon, and haven't found any answers... Anyway, I got several different effects, mostly visual. It was like there was another, thin layer of reality inside the walls of my room; which was where most of the stuff I saw was. There was also a thin layer over my vision - where the shadows and definitions of distance in my room made up another realm that I could kind of see into. There was a fair amount of translucent spiders, and they felt pretty real. They moved completely realistically, y'know the spider movements that make your skin crawl and shit. The only time they did more than moving around inside the wall though was when one came out from behind my poster, and suddenly dropped down towards me before vanishing. I jumped pretty hard lol. Occasionally I saw some bugs, like a centipede, one of those deep sea spider crabs, a beatle, and even bacteria like you'd see moving under a microscope. All translucent though. If my eyes unfocused, the realm I could very faintly see within the natural shadows in my room would show me huge shadow spiders; that for some reason were always directly walking towards me. I also had little visual glitches. Pieces of different things in my room would jump out of place, then go right back when I would look directly at it. There were little light distortions. Out of the corner of my eye my poster would be distorted or show something different. After a while I even saw a few faces in the wall, although they were mostly translucent and didn't go anywhere else. If I focused on them I would hear their voice in my head. They felt kind of sinister. As I laid there I also noticed my thoughts this whole time had been wild, nonsensical and almost cartoony. Just kind of going like that in the background. I was also pretty tired at this point, and as I focused more on the nonsensical thinking; occasionally the things I was seeing in my head would suddenly appear on a surface in my vision, almost as though that item had turned into a flat screen TV. These effects, while definitely present; weren't very strong or overwhelming. I didn't have much of a headspace other than a mild, numb delirious state, and physically just lethargy. I fell asleep after an hour or so. This was all very wierd for me. I didn't feel negative at all during it, I was just morbidly curious and fascinated by what I was experiencing. I did notice things had, just...an overall sinister feel to them. But it wasn't enough to freak me out. I am aware how nightmarish benadryl can get on high doses, how excruciatingly physically unpleasant and even permanently traumatizing and damaging the mental state can be. And so I still don't ever want to go there even after this. I am extremely curious though, I do want to see more of what I saw with this. I think in a week or so I'll try and recreate the experience. Take adderall again, wait a couple hours or so and this time take a somewhat larger benadryl dose. Definitely not more than 100/150mg if only 50 did this to me. In the meantime if any of you have any clue how this was chemically or psychologically possible I'd love to hear it. TL;DR - I took a standard benadryl dose on an adderall comedown to try and fall asleep; it made me dph trip and I can't figure out how or why. I did my best to outline the experience.","Occasionally I've taken 25/50mg to get to sleep at night but I've definitely never experienced anything on it before other than getting drowsy...so, like twenty minutes later I'm getting in bed, and I turn on this white noise ten hour youtube video I sometimes use to help me sleep.",578,3,1

I only started referring to it as a disease recently. I was stupid enough to think how can negative thoughts, and emotions be a disease. Its not rocket science. I have a chemical imbalance in the brain that requires me to see a psychologist and take medications. It by no means is cured. My psychologist tends to compare it to diabetes (Ive gotten flak for the comparison), in which it never really goes away, Ive just gotta learn to manage it. I have a shitty attitude, and miserable demeanor. Not afraid to admit it. Ive done some terrible things in my life that I carry extreme guilt for. I would apologize to those Ive affected but they would prefer to never see me again, which I cant blame them. The bridges burned, the insults spewed, the disinterest in others, it can be rooted to one thing, depression. Its caused me to drive away every friend I have. Ive become a better person though, Ive completely dropped drugs and alcohol, and go to the gym everyday. Although Ive tainted my reputation as a person. Its hard for people to give me a second chance, in which I understand. Long story short, I hope someone can relate to this post. I only speak to two people a week, my psychologist, and trainer.

s_782_6,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"On recurring, severe depression and the will to live Live is a journey that always has an end regardless of how we live, and it's one most people enjoy or simply wouldn't like to end. However, what is life without the joy of living? What is living not for you but to avoid hurting your family or because another being depends on you and your love, say a child or a pet? That's a long torture that seems to have no end and it consumes you slowly but steadily if you don't find anything that makes you enjoy being there, and that's the problem; sometimes there isn't anything, not a light awaiting for you, not a thing that gives you a speck of happiness but only momentary joy that fades as soon as it ends. Non-depressed people sometimes say ""happiness is a choice"" and ""it's the little things that together form happiness"", but no. For some of us Happiness is not a choice but an uphill struggle for something seemingly unattainable and those little things mean nothing because they fade away. Therapy and different medications and procedures have helped thousands to overcome and get over their depression, but it's but frustrating when years pass, you try to give your best despite barely having energy for days in a row and despite feeling miserable inside when awake and despite wearing a ""mask"" in front of other people and when you adhere to prescribed drugs that make some things even worse just to try and hit the root cause but nothing improves inside. I could give you my personal elaborate and detailed sob-story, but it doesn't really matter here because one of my root caused for my depression is that I have no desire of living, I don't want to be here and keep feeling pain, both physical and psychological. "" Life has no meaning"" sounds like an overused cliche, but it's parcially true. I don't want to keep living because my life has no purpose anymore. I'm tired of trying to give it a meaning and I'm fed up. Some suicide attempts left mw crying qfter all the pain and once, the thought of my mother just at the other side of the door and she waking me up cheerfully the next morning, but again, living for others can only go so fqr, and this is the breaking point where the point of not caring anymore if I can get rid of this pain is becoming stronger and coming closer again.

s_1278_99,Find evidence for sleep issues in this post,"What is following me? I thought this was over. I wasn't going to post my story because I thought my life was back to normal. That was before last night. When weird things started happening, my step father had just been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. The only people in my house were my mom, my step dad, my boyfriend, and me. My step father couldn't go to the bathroom himself, and if my mom had to go, she would call me into the living room to sit with him. He was never unattended. Furthermore, my room was right beside the bathroom. I could hear anyone coming in or out. Let me also explain about my step father, he was a police officer and where I live, police have to get extensive physicals every year to stay on the force. He also frequently got strep, so he had blood work done every time he had it due to the hospital visit. We had just moved into an older house, and I always felt uneasy in the house. There was just something off about it. Less than a year after we move, my step dad who has always been given a clean bill of health was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. They said it had to have been there for at least 6-7 years. We had no clue where it had come from. I immediately thought of A Haunting in Connecticut, how the boy got sicker after moving into an old house. How else would I explain my step father getting so sick so fast? When the weird stuff started happening to me, my boyfriend isn't living with me. I have always been deathly afraid of the dark. I've slept with my tv on for as long as I can remember. I can't stand the sounds houses make at night, so the sound drowns it out and provides light. I sleeping pretty peacefully when it was disturbed by a dream that wouldn't be scary to normal people. It was an older lady glaring at me. I've never seen this lady, but I had a deep feeling that she was evil and wanted to cause me harm. I woke up with a jolt and was overwhelmed with the same feeling I had in the dream. I can't explain how I know, but I knew it was her. Then I quickly noticed my tv was off. My mom wouldn't turn my tv off because she knows I need it. I got a horrible feeling of dread through me. I quickly grabbed my remote to get the tv back on. Needless to say, I didn't go back to sleep that night. About a month and a half later, I was still getting that terrified feeling throughout my house occasionally, but I was starting I get used to it because my boyfriend started staying with me. We had been laying in bed all day because it was one of my few days off, so I would know if anyone had gone to the bathroom recently. When I got up to use the bathroom, I could hear water running, which was very odd because no one had been in there. It wasn't possible. When I opened the bathroom door, our bathroom was flooded because someone (something?) had turned our sink on full blast. I quickly called out to my mom who confirmed my suspicions. No one had been to the bathroom. As we cleaned the mess, my mom was comforting me, and I let her reason calm me, quickly turning away any thoughts of paranormal. Sadly, the next part in my story was the worst time in my life. My step father had just been taken to the hospital, and the family had been called in. We were living at the hospital basically. My mom made me go to my grandmother's to get some rest, so my friend Molly drove me and My friend Robin to our respective houses. On the way to Robin's, Molly slammed the brakes and asked if we had seen something run I front of the car. Neither of us had, so we just assumed it was an animal because we live in a mountainous area. Animals weren't uncommon. Nothing happened the rest of the ride, until Molly dropped me off at the end of my drive way. As I was walking toward my house, I saw the figure of a man duck behind a car, so I took off at a sprint to get to the safety of home. When I turned around, I saw a black cat walking toward me from where I had just seen the man. I got into the house and locked the door. I texted Molly what had happened. She replied, ""I don't want to scare you anymore, but I thought it was a black cat that I saw driving Robin home..."" After a short conversation, I drifted off into an uneasy sleep. The next day, I went to my house to clean up some. I must explain that I lived in a high class neighborhood, so there were no stray animals around. When I got to my house, I saw a black cat sitting beside the door. After that, I quickly cleaned up because I didn't want to be in that house any longer. My step father died that night. For a couple months after my step father died, everything was calm, so I chocked everything that had happened as stress. Then one morning as I was getting ready for class, I was brushing my teeth before I showered. I went to turn the water off, but I didn't turn the handle all the way, so I had to reach and turn the handle further. I got in the shower, but when I got out. The water was turned on full blast. After that, I started getting ready faster in the mornings, so I didn't have to be in the house. One morning, my mom was still home, so I decided to take my time getting ready. When I was in the shower, I could clearly hear my step father saying hello to me. I didn't get the terrified feeling I normally got. Instead I was filled with joy. The last thing that happened in that house before we moved happened around 3 am. I was working late shift, so it was common that I would be cooking at these times. As I was waiting on the oven to heat up, the coffee pot came on without anyone touching it. Now, some might think it could have been set like an alarm, but no one in my house drinks coffee. It was my step father's, so I went to investigate and the coffee pot wasn't even plugged in. Finally, this brings me to the present. My mother went to the beach, but I stayed home because I had to work. One night, I heard growling coming from my living room, but both dogs were in bed with me. There was nothing in the house to make that sound. I closed my bedroom door and laid in bed, until I couldn't stay awake anymore. I was ecstatic when Mom came home the next day. Finally, last night, the thing that made me post my story. I was going to get ready for work, so I walked through the house to get a towel. When I came back through, my mom asked what I was doing. I told her going to shower for work. She looked at me confused and said she thought I had already showered. She heard it running. My mom and I are the only ones in the house. I went to the bathroom to check out her claim. Nothing was out of place, no running water. I still didn't shower that night. Please, tell me what is following my family and why it only affects me.

s_1846_53,Find evidence for fatigue in this post,"Afraid to go to the hospital, Afraid to go to work, One has to happen. This will be a messy post, I'm sure. Running on very little sleep the past few days. Where to start.. Maybe a little about myself. I'm a 24 year old female. Friday night my significant other decided to break off our relationship. Needless to say this was upsetting, though it wasn't really the problem. The problem is I've been using the relationship as a sort of bandage to cover up numerous insecurities and phobias. Now that its gone, there is nothing holding back the floodgates in my head. Word vomit is spinning in circles around my mind and driving me crazy for lack of a better term. What seems to help quiet the noise in my head is interacting with other people and pacing or doing another activity that requires use of my, at the moment, very limited supply of energy. Friday night, or Saturday morning I should probably say, I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am when I passed out from pure exhaustion. I woke up a little under two hours later after a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I spent the rest of the morning quietly pacing the house and shaking from the effort until my roommate woke up and we could start our day. Now its 2 am on Sunday and I'm so very tired that its making me sick. I'm hungry too but I'm fairly sure if I eat I'll throw up. I seem to have terrible nightmares when I'm stressed and after last night I'm not really eager to do a repeat. But I desperately need to sleep. When I lay down I can't stop the spiral of thoughts from crashing down on me so I started just kind of rocking back and forth and petting my dog, trying really hard to not think about anything at all. It occurs to me now that its highly doubtful I can function like this at work on Monday, having what will probably be a total of only 4 hours of sleep in a 72 ish hour period. I feel like my body is already trying to shut down. But if I don't go to work then I will need a damn good excuse. At this point, the only thing I can come up with is going to admit myself to the hospital. Which might not be such a bad idea given my mental state, but I'm absolutely terrified of the place. I had to spend a week in the psychiatric ward about 4 years ago and over half that week was not voluntary. The doctors were not friendly and most of the other patients either annoyed or scared me. Participating in the group activities was very difficult because I'm extremely shy, which made me seem even more difficult to the doctors, who subsequently liked me even less. I could tell I was frustrating them because all I wanted to do was sleep and pace around my room until they fixed my medication to their liking and I could leave. They didn't think fixing my medication was good enough so I asked to leave at which point I was told that I would then be held involuntarily and would end up needing a court order to leave and spend a minimum of 30 days there if I didn't calm down. At that point I became extremely claustrophobic and panicked and spent a day refusing to talk to anyone. They chalked this behavior up to a bad reaction to a new medication they had just tried to switch me to and switch me to something else. Things did get a little better from there but the facility was still very daunting. The sheets were not comfortable to sleep on and having someone come in to my room every hour wore on my nerves to the point where I broke a few times and told them to get out. I try very hard to always be polite and not throw fits like that but to me this hospital environment was truly terrible and I wanted desperately to go home the whole time. Most of the books I asked to be brought I wasn't even allowed to read because they were science fiction and the doctors said that they would encourage some delusions. I'm not anxious to go back to this hospital for any kind of mental condition. The thought absolutely terrifies me. So does the thought of losing my job and not being able to pay my bills. I believe if I do admit myself to the hospital, my job cannot legally fire me and likely wouldn't because they do sincerely seem to like me. I've only been at this place for 6 months and already had to miss two days from two separate episodes of strep throat. I hate missing work. I want them to see me as reliable. I'm only a temp and not hired on permanently yet so I'm worried too that if the hospital kept me too long, they could let me go anyways simply because I am only there on a temp basis right now and they don't need a valid reason. I could try and go to work Monday, but I'm already cringing at the thought. I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today. and I'm physically sick from not being able to eat enough. I feel like throwing up and have a terrible headache from crying and having a little panic attack (at least I think that's what it was, I've never had one of those before). I work in a cubicle doing data entry. The work is very repetitive and will allow me too much time to dwell on things that I really don't need to be thinking about right now. Which will likely just make me cry and then panic because I can't stop crying and I'd be too near people that they might hear. Talking about my diminished mental state with any of my coworkers is not something I want to do. I do not want to seem mentally unfit in anyway to my boss. I cannot afford to lose this job. So I am caught between a rock and a very hard place. Going to the hospital would be terrifying and I don't want to do that. Going to work in this state is also equally undesirable. I am not sure what to do.",I'm shaking from lack of sleep and trying to exert to much energy today.,4619,5,1

s_2257_110,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"Multiple issues including OCD,ADHD,Bipolar and BPD? First of all: I am a university student on weekends and I am doing a full time job on weekdays. I am in my mid twenties. I still live with my parents and I don't own any vehicle of my own. The usual length of the university degree I am following is 4 years, and this is my 6th year, because I still have failed subjects and I am trying to retake them and graduate as soon as possible. The job I work on does not suit me, I mean I am bored and I seldom feel interested in the work I do. Why do I still hang around in the job? It pays me (considerably lower than the usual pay but it still pays something) and I want to be independent of my parents. They have paid for my university degree too, and I feel like I should take care of my expenses by myself. I am scared that I'd be a burnout, because I am bored to death of everything in my life. I feel that I have more than one mental health issue: anxiety, depression most likely, and OCD, ADHD(or ADD) and possibly Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Also, I believe I am addicted to porn and social media and junk food. Let me explain the rationale behind my conclusions. Anxiety and depression: Pretty sure, because I often am nervous when carrying out even the simplest tasks and interacting with others (even my family members), and I love my comfort zones like my bed and my room and I feel uneasy whenever I have to leave them. I feel overwhelmed among crowds and I tend to avoid crowded places. It's kinda funny, because I have a thing for singing, and it usually requires performing in front of a crowd. I have done it very few times, and needless to say, I felt very anxious and hard to perform. I cannot handle pressure, especially when there are deadlines. Though I think this is related to ADHD as well. I think I have depression because I am sad most of the time. It's just I don't see many reasons to be happy about in my life right now. I tend to overthink even the smallest and silliest things, and then the end goal is feeling distraught. I spend a lot of time on Social media or daydreaming or sleeping because I feel bored by my university work and office work. I lack enthusiasm to do even the daily tasks like taking a shower or brushing teeth. OCD : I have a habit of repetition of things, washing my hands a lot and checking out if the door is locked immediately after I've locked the door, I feel the need of organizing trivial things. When I see my room unorganized, it really bugs me. So I think this conclusion is pretty justified. I have an acne issue on my skin and I cannot stop myself from picking on scabs and I believe OCD is one of the reasons that I cannot get rid of acne. ADHD or ADD : This one I recently got to know. I have issues in focusing and attention. I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long. if a tas requires a lot of organizing, I spend a lot of time getting ready for that and sometimes try to avoid it altogether. I get easily distracted by surroundings and sometimes my own thoughts. I often doze off in group conversations, this has become a big problem because this happens a lot in office video calls and I don't remember what topics were discussed during the call. I suck at time management and prioritizing my work. I can be forgetful. Bipolar : I have rapid mood swings; one second I'm happy and the next I'm not. I get irritated easily, for simple to no reasons. Sometimes I am really energized up and sometimes I'm lethargic. Sometimes I can talk with someone else for more than one hour and sometimes I don't feel like talking at all. BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) : I feel like either I have more than one personality or I have none whatsoever. I find my interests vary from time to time: for example sometimes I feel like I love football, and sometimes I don't find it very exciting. I have different kinds of thoughts and feelings and they can change rather quickly. So are my interests. I feel like a lot of debate going inside my head on different topics. Maybe this isn't actually BPD. A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed. I still get them from time to time. I sometimes feel like I am not afraid of death anymore (I used to be scared of death all the time), as long as the way of dying is painless and quick, it's just I have stopped worrying about afterlife. Main reason I am still staying here is that I have a responsibility to my family and I have to take care of them, otherwise I would have actually turned this off long ago. I have seen this thing called cycles when expressing depression, which I haven't really experienced. It's like my whole life recently has been one big singular cycle which never ends. Social media addiction : I use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit and I spend a lot of time surfing through them and I cannot control it. Porn addiction : I usually watch porn and masturbate at least once a day and I feel like it's affecting my sleep cycle. My sleep cycle is in disarray. Junk food : Perhaps this is stress eating. I cannot go by myself for a few hours without having a snack or some junk food or a drink (Non alcoholic). I find it incredibly difficult to tackle with 1 of them, because something else from the above list can intervene and make it harder. I once met a psychologist or a psychiatrist and I tried to explain the whole thing to him, but he dismissed my claims and I felt really really hurt after that. I mean I have already paid, why couldn't he listen to me? Because of that, and for obvious anxiety reasons, I find it hard to actually meet a psychiatrist again. So, if you made it to the end, props to you. What do you think?","A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed.",4120,8,1

s_2908_119,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"A couple of things for me personally: cheating; overeating; gambling addiction; mental illness; and same-sex relationships. 1) Cheating. This is a different perspective, and I know a lot of people will downvote me for it or say I'm a horrible person, but I'm talking from the side of the cheater. I cheated on my ex-boyfriend. I was wrong for it. I promised myself I'd never do it again with any other person in the future. I also never did such a thing before. I was in an abusive relationship, mentally and emotionally, and my ex had secluded himself away as a means of punishment. I had moved 1500 miles away from family and friends to be with him. He refused letting me make any friends, and he always checked on me often to make sure I wasn't doing anything with anybody. Then, he told me to move out because it made his life difficult. In order for our relationship to ""make it,"" I had to move into my own place while I worked a temp job that I wasn't sure was going to last long. I did what I had to and moved out into my own place for the first time in my life. I was alone; had no one to turn to as he had me believe my family was an enemy; and I did the only thing I could. I found someone online, talked to them for a long time, and finally decided to meet up. It ended up becoming something sexual. We had sex more than once on multiple occasions. It got to the point where we had feelings for each other and I shut it down. Then, I told my ex. We stayed together another year after that, but I knew it wasn't going to work out and ultimately ended it. But it still messes with me, the way he has me programmed to think I'm unworthy of life without him. Nobody to blame but myself. 2) Overeating often is an eating disorder. It isn't just someone who cannot control themselves. It becomes an addiction, a mental condition and it causes you to make horrible mistakes to the point where your mental and physical self becomes garbage. Can people change? But that doesn't mean it's easy and it doesn't mean everyone can do it the same way as everyone else. I'm tired of these anti-fat people thinking bullying is going to solve the problem. It doesn't. Has it helped some? But I was bullied all my life and I only got fatter. 3) Gambling addiction. It's a different kind of addiction. People look at me strange when I say I have a gambling addiction. They tell me their stories of how they just don't take enough money with them for it to matter or that they know when to stop and leave or if they're up they leave. That's great. I tried it all. I still continue to go until I'm literally broke and spent the rent/bill money, the student loan money, the taxes, other people's money. I have a problem. Thankfully, I'm seeing someone for it and I've been 1 month sober, but it isn't just a simple fix. There's some deep emotional shit in your head that keeps you going back for more to feel like you're worth something. At least, that's how it is for me. 4) I suffer from depression due to low self-esteem as well as a list of other things as you can tell from my response. It's hard when you're trying to get your life together but you have zero energy or you're not sleeping well or you become anxious when talking to strangers in order to get a job/keep a job. It's particularly more difficult when you're trying to find the right dose of drugs to help keep you on an even keel so you can be a regular person without crying every two seconds. I'm now off any drugs and I seem to be doing really well. Been off them for 4 months now. Let's hope I continue doing well. I asked to be on drugs, not prescribed them by a psychiatrist. 5) I'm gay and I've been in many same-sex relationships. Many people in my life seem to make it out that same-sex relationships aren't real relationships or that same-sex relationships aren't the same as heterosexual relationships. My mother often argued that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be in a deep, emotional relationship because we're the same gender. My ex-friend told me that my ex and I could never understand what it's like to be married because we didn't have the right to be married and therefore could never understand the deep emotional ties you create when you say 'I do.' Meanwhile, she's now getting a divorce from said husband that she said she was so close to a year and a half ago.",Nobody to blame but myself.,1666,6,1

After all of these months of putting together the pieces, like an expert piecing back together a plane after a horrible crash, I finally have a good picture and can say that this was all my fault. If I could see you now I'd hug you and tell you how sorry I am, and that I don't really know what to do or who I am right now but I'm trying anyway. I never imagined that we'd end up this way, or that I'd be where I am right now. I know you've found love with someone else and all I can think is how much you deserve someone who's better than me. How were you ever supposed to love me when I can't love myself?, when deep down I'm so fundamentally twisted up inside. You have a good heart to have ever been able to love someone like me. You probably don't think too kindly of me these days, the only person to blame for that is me. These days I don't know if I'll ever be able to stand on my own two feet again. We talk now and then, but I don't know if I've let on how beaten out of the race I really am. So many ""what ifs"" run through my brain everyday; ""What if I hadn't gotten sick?"" "" What if I'd been more patient"" ""What if I wasn't scared."" We both wish I could just leave it in the past and move forward, but I just can't. I'm too afraid. I miss coming home to you, I miss watching movies, just talking in the shower and going for walks through the nice end of town. I miss how we'd snuggle close to each other before falling asleep, how your legs and arms would get cold so you'd curl around me. I miss when it was just me and you under blankets in the backs of cars and listening to songs from the 80's. I miss you calling me late at night to ask if I wanted to go smoke cigars in the rain and then waiting for me to kiss you. All of that seems so far away now, like a dream, like something that never happened. I've lost you, you're so far away now, and I'm so afraid that I'm losing myself too. All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery. I'm cold, bitter, and a worse man than I was before, maybe I've always been worse. I really hope you find real happiness, and no matter what happens to me, if I don't pull myself back, and can never stand by on my own again, it's not because of you.","All I feel is guilt, anger and remorse, it's only fitting that I'm the source of my own misery.",1989,6,1

I'm 36, she's 70, but alcoholism runs in our family and I know she takes antidepressants. Her house was the closest to where the incident occurred, and I (somehow) managed to make it that far, walk in, and collapse on the ground sobbing. But after awhile, I did tell her, ""I faced my suicide today. And, the silver lining is, I said no."" As I said it's not making me happy. But there is a relief. So um, follow up, and this part's still being processed kinda. I live in a semi-rural area, and my job involves a lot of driving, and winter and all that bullshit. That's what lead to the event. And I had another job. Less than 24 hours later. ( Late edit for context: it was about another 100 miles of driving.) I called my mom. I told her, I need you to do this for me, but I will be lying down in the back seat, under a blanket the whole time. Because, if I can't get through that, I might never drive again. ( This is part of my depression post - why blame myself for all I need help for?) Mostly got through it. There was a total panic attack near catastrophe, but also another good thought.

s_2437_0,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Up late Thought I'd post Im 17 years old going into my senior year in high school. The past years of high school have been rough. Freshman year most of my friends went off to hang out with other cliques and shit and started acting like dicks (HIGHSCHOOL WOW). In the winter of my sophomore year I got diagnosed with fucking type 1 diabetes. I'm to embarrassed to tell anyone I'm diabetic which leads to me not taking insulin for days on end. After I got hit with diabetes about two years ago I really stopped giving a fuck. I started smoking weed and drinking shortly after getting it, my grades went to shit too. As soon as I discovered weed I knew I was gonna be hooked. It was the easiest way to get rid of all of my problems temporarily and I loved it, I was smoking 4 times a day by that summer. In my head I knew getting diabetes triggered all this drug use and shit but I really didn't care, I never really valued myself before I got diagnosed but the way I saw it getting diabetes was my excuse to get away with a ton of shit. My parents first caught me with weed a week after I smoked for the first time. They drug tested me and then took my shit, my Dad whooped my ass and then screamed at me to never do it again. I promised him I wouldn't but I was fucking lying right through my teeth. I was so fucking mad the first time I got caught, I felt like I never got my turn to actually experiment with weed before I got caught. Getting caught by my parents triggered a whole downward cycle. They would catch me like once every two weeks after that and I was grounded 24/7. Obviously I wasn't going to stop smoking weed so I could be ungrounded so, I constantly snuck out and ran away to go get drunk or high with my friends. This went on for about 6 months and as time went on my relationship with my parents got worse. To the point where my mom refused to speak to me for a week after I didn't confess to stealing $500 from her wallet (money that was supposed to be spent on my Dad for his birthday. I'm such a piece of shit I know). Last January I ran away one evening and took 25i NBOME (pretty much fake lsd- I thought It was real at the time) and had a horrible trip. During the trip I felt like my life was stuck in the same 1 hour loop for eternity along with some other scary shit. Afterwards though I was fucking losing my mind. My ego was completely shattered and all I wanted to do when I got home was apologies to my parents and cry with my Mom. I though I had given myself brain damage so after coming clean to my parents I vowed to stay sober and rebuild my relationship with my parents (no brain damage though). My Mom put me in therapy that February and I started taking anti anxiety meds soon after. I thought that if I cleaned up my act it would help me understand more about who I am but that didn't work at all and after suffering for two months sober I started doing drugs again last April. It's July now. Im still stealing from my parents to buy weed. I hate myself completely but I don't care about myself enough to fix anything. My parents are really pushing my to go to collage but I'm really not interested at all. I feel as if this is all being forced upon me and I don't get a say. All my parents seem to care about is getting me into a collage so they can go brag to their fucking friends about me. They make me so fucking mad. I'm still in therapy but it really isn't helping. My parents caught me again and I got into a huge fight with my Dad where I ended up running away, stealing a 40 oz from 711 and sleeping on a park bench. My parents I just don't care about anything in anymore. My life is meaningless, all life is in general. It's impossible for anyone to be content ever. I feel that because I'm aware of the sad reality of this world i'll never be able to be happy. I don't want to pick a career, I don't want to go to collage and I really don't want to live anymore. The only thing stopping me from jumping off a bridge one night is my irrational fear that when we die we stay in our bodies unable to move or communicate. Thus leaving me stuck inside a box for all of eternity. That wouldn't explain what would happen to people who are cremated though. I digress

s_1514_217,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"The Grey Riders [Part Two] My popcorn doesn't have any butter on it, but I prefer it such. Sliding awkwardly between seatbacks and knees, I make my way to our reserved seats at the center of the theater just as the lights go down. I've always loved the cool sanctuary feel of a dark movie theater as I watch both the distant screen from my high seat and an Empire-born movie from my hidden Amber World. Do they know we see what they create? While carefully arranging and depositing sodas, bags, popcorn, a tray of pretzel bites, and a half-eaten bag of red vine knockoffs, I say of the movie we've come to see, ""This is a good one!"" A calm older man to my right smiles. The effect of his sincere cheer is made more pronounced by his slightly crooked nose. "" What's it called?"" ""Die Hard,"" I tell him. Finally situated, I turn my head to my companion on my left. "" You've seen this one, right Tacitus?"" The kind man to my right taps me on the shoulder. I turn back, still excited. "" He tilts his head toward the screen. The moving image seems monstrous in scope, and certainly far larger than I've ever seen such a theatre contain. This particular preview is so full of energy and raw sensory brilliance that it presses upon my very optic and aural nerves. The film being marketed is odd as well; a bruised and battered woman of about twenty with matted metallic red hair is trapped in the clutches of some sort of limbed black sphere. She was hit in the head rather forcefully, and is now briefly unconscious. At that moment, the strange assailant's whirring drill is just beginning to penetrate her skull. What is that?"" The man to my right grimaces in unhappy concern and leans closer to whisper so that the other patrons might not know of our conversation. "" A scout, you could say. Or, perhaps more appropriately, an antibodythe first of many."" As my heart beats to a racing terror in my chest, I tell him, ""I don't think I like this trailer."" My eyes are stuck on the screen, but his gaze bores into my temple with a keening fire. He whispers with rather serious intent: ""It's trying to learn about you. If I were you, I wouldn't let it."" ""She can't get the angle,"" I protest painfully, unable to move for the strict and cramped tightness of my seat. The arms of the chair feel closer every second; the more I struggle, the harder I find myself held. His gaze now feels like shrieking fire against my tilted temple, and I bash backwards repeatedly against my unhappy former sanctuary to no avail. My gunI have a gun! Not popcorn, not a soda, but a weapon clamped to my chest by black limbs. It is pointed up at my coldly merciless assailant, yes, but my head happens to be in the way first. My kind companion turns away with respectful compassion at what he senses I am about to do. I can't get my head out of the way, but I don't need tonot entirely. Opening my mouth as wide as I can in an adrenaline-filled scream, I tilt hard to the right and fire. In that instant, a deafening ringing takes over my hearing. The explosive force rips through my cheek with all the fire I expected, returning me to full consciousness as the restraining limbs fall away. I fought through the sense-blinding pain to crawl and stumble away from the nightmarish thing. By seizing me rather than moving and dodging, it had finally given me a solid shot, and I had taken that shot no matter the cost. It had been practiced skill, not luck, that had helped me avoid destroying my teeth on either side of my planned vector. Holding up my bleeding cheek with one shaking hand and my gun with the other, I turned around and faced it again. That had been my last loaded bullet, and it had finally had an effect. The stunned sphere dragged across the ground in jittery confusion. What important part of it had I hit? I gagged against the overpowering taste of gunpowder and blood in my mouth and nose and throat and ears. My temple burned, but the tender exposed bone there was still intact. My nearly numb fingers ran across warm and wet scored ridges in my skull where the drill had begun its work. Explosions and flashes of light punctuated the distance, but those were too distant to reach my dulled awareness. Caught in the instinctive programming of my training, I let one clip slide out and reached for another. Seated, snapped, clickedI was in control again. Holding my gun out and at the ready, I guarded the zig-zagging sphere as the roar of engines became immediate. Flanked by her three heavily armed comrades, Caecilia removed her helmet, kicked her stand, and remained at a distance with her assault rifle slung forward. "" Venita, are you alright?"" I tried to speak, but the magmatic salt in my mouth forced me to cough instead. I could only nod. ""Is it wounded?"" I nodded again, and spit twice. Finally, by tightly holding my open cheek with one hand, I could manage a decent attempt at speaking. "" Could killed me, but held me, drill into my brain instead."" My tattered dark blue uniform was no longer snappy; despite the wave and the ride, the Dangerous Four in their Special Assault black and trimmed gold looked every bit the savior heroes I'd hoped for, an image reinforced by their daunting semi-automatic weapons. With their helmets now all off, their eyes were intent, and they scattered to surround the malfunctioning sphere at a distance. One of them shouted, ""What do you think its purpose was by drilling into your head?"" Confirming what they suspected, I answered, ""Learning."" Caecilia inched closer to it with a grin. "" Then how about we return the favor?"" After kicking it once and backing away, she stopped its random movement by stepping fully upon it. Her team closed in, and I edged up behind them warily. A chunk of the black exterior was missing thanks to my desperate shot, and we could see strange workings within. Both carefully organized machine parts and pulsing organs worked in tandem inside, and one of its cores was visible. The brunette woman I'd spoken to on my first day all those years ago asked, ""You guys recognize that?"" Caecilia nodded. "" Rainbow crystal. Looks like agravitational Yngtak lattices. That must be how it floats like thatchanges in internal harmonics. But I don't recognize these other technologies."" As we watched, parts of a shattered liver-like organ began cleaving back together rather rapidly. One of the two men realized aloud: ""It's regenerating...""
Caecilia looked sharply back to the rift. "" Venita, it came from there?"" I nodded emphatically despite the pain burning in my every nerve. ""Then we'll send it back where it came from and seal the hole behind it!"" Their confident blonde leader gave a more specific order without words, and the two men of her squad reached down to pick up the damaged sphere. Two glimmering black blades erupted from the device near their hands, nearly slicing them both. The men leapt back, but then nodded at each otherthere had to be a limit to its shapechanging. Carefully gripping the blades with extended fingers, they lifted the double-pointed sphere and ran toward the rift in perfect sync. Not far behind, I followed Caecilia and the other woman right behind, our guns at the ready. As they neared the truck that I had smashed into the hole in the fabric of space, I saw Caecilia leap and roll to her right, and I automatically did the same in the opposite direction. A split second later, a long black blade shot past and impacted into a fallen log. Another long blade sang out with the squeal of changing metal; the man on the left of the sphere threw himself back to the ground to avoid the limb. The man on the right was not quick enough to avoid the third blade, and it stabbed down through his thigh and into the ground. Just as quickly as the blades had sprung out to pierce into the surrounding environs and anchor the sphere, the pinned man swung his gun down and fired a rapid burst into the core of the thing. It whined and died with its mechanical guts hanging outchrome and flesh entrails leaked by a vile black pustule whose sudden barbs had prevented us from removing it from our world. Caecilia peered through the holes it had drilled in the truck on its way in while the other two sawed at the black blade in their comrade's thigh with their combat knives. Still in shock myself, I just stood and watched. I felt like I'd seen something like this in an old Empire science fiction show, and that situation had not ended well for the characters involved. How many shows about doomed worlds had I watched in my youth, entertained by the notion of the end of civilization? Now it was happening to *us*. Backing away from the ruined truck, the normally confident blonde bore a subtly sickened look of intense focus. "" There are more coming."" ""How many?"" the pinned man asked just before gritting his teeth against the pain. She began scanning the shattered road and forest. An instant later, she sprang into action and began pulling at a heavy nearby rock. "" We need to block this. Everything."" Her brunette teammate stopped pulling on the blade in her comrade's leg long enough to ask, ""Ceece, *how many?*"" The blonde just shook her head as she carried her rock over and placed it at the foot of the door to the world with the yellow sky. "" Cram our motorcycles into the holes in this rift, and then hotwire those cars and drive them up on the whole thing!"" They didn't hesitate. After freeing blade from thigh, they ran from vehicle to vehicle, spinning their engines to life in short order. Even their injured member helped carry things, and that snapped me out of my daze. While deep booms radiated through the earth from afar and curling explosions mushroomed into the sky on the horizon, we focused solely on this one point of vulnerability and did our jobs as best we could. It helped me not to panic, but I was completely and utterly exhausted by the time my allies roared in on their own bikes. ""Add 'em to the pile!"" Caecilia shouted to Porcia, Rufus, Septus, and my beloved Flavia, who had now all arrived in their dusty and torn dark blue uniforms wearing expressions of haste and concern. Porcia protested, ""It took us ages to find these""
""It won't matter if those things get through!"" Caecilia pointed to the outsized black burr that had stuck itself into a log, the ground, and a massive displaced boulder. "" They're agravitational, transmorphic, and intelligently adaptive. Don't underestimate them."" Flavia responded for my group. "" Understood."" She nodded to the others, and my four ran their bikes to the pile and threw them on top. This was no time for questions of authority, and, like me, my friends knew when to listen to greater experience and skill. Coming over to me, Flavia touched my wounded temple and cheek and grimaced. "" Porcia, what do you think?"" The more medically-inclined member of our group gave me a weak smile. "" You're not gonna die, but you're not going to look great for your date, either."" Behind her, heavy rock in his arms, my red-haired Rufus asked with surprised wide eyes, ""*Date?*"" While dragging a log, Septus laughed. "" I think I have an inkling of who it might be with!"" To tell the truth, I was crying. They were alive, and they were here, and their presence helped dispel some of the nightmare that had descended around my heart. I told them in the formal tongue, ""Focus your attentions. This is important."" With a happy sob, I informally added, ""I'm glad you're here."" As one, they gave synced serious nods. Flavia spoke for them: ""Of course."" Our pile of machinery, rock, and logs became rather excessive as all nine of us labored to bury the rift in as much debris as we could. It was fortunate, in some small manner, that the grey wave had churned up such destruction; whole unearthed boulders were available for moving, and one was so heavy that it took all nine of us to waddle it up and drop it into place. Crushing the cabin of the truck once and for all, it served as a keystone seal atop our mountain. ""That's enough,"" Caecilia ordered between heaving breaths. Covered in sweat and breathing hard, Porcia protested: ""I can keep going."" Our leader shook her head. "" We can't be exhausted for what's coming. Every scrap of energy will be critical."" We sat under the strange breezes and distant thunders of ongoing battles elsewhere; each of us slowly began breathing at a more normal pace as we recovered our limbs and our lungs. New whinings began somewhere deep in our pilehigh squeals denoting the progress of our enemies as they took to drillingbut Caecilia held a hand up to keep us silent and resting. I knew that it was important we take every second we could to let our energies rise, but I was dismayed that I hadn't thought of the importance of silence as well. I had done it naturally while alone, but this was a more strategic situation; these drilling spheres had no idea what was on the other side, for we had destroyed their scout, and it was to our advantage to take them by surprise. Exchanging words of courage and comfort might have felt like the natural thing to do, but, in this case, it was incorrect. We looked at each other often, wiped sweat from our brows, and slowed our breathing in tacit silence. Given a chance to let my adrenaline pass, I began to shake, and the echoes of gunshots from both horizons set me on edge. Were they faring any better out there? Were their threats easier or worse? It sounded like a dozen drills were at work below us, and I kept re-living the nearly fatal struggle I'd had with just one. Without a word, Caecilia climbed noiselessly down and motioned for us to follow. We nine each found positions behind various vehicles, rocks, or logs. Flavia kneeled with me this time, and her calm touch stilled my shaking gun hand. The second wave was coming, but, this time, I had more than just Tacitus' spirit by my side. It was then, too, that Flavia finally noticed his absence, and she looked to me in askance; I shook my head sadly. She took this wordless news in stride, closed her eyes for a long moment, and then faced our blockade with fire in her eyes. These things hadn't killed Tacitus, but it didn't matter. Either way, they would pay. As before, the drilling stopped without warning. None of us moved. The warm breeze from an explosion to our left blew dust to the side and rustled our hair, but we remained aimed and ready. The kick came, and one of the boulders ruptured in half; we waited unmoving as six black spheres hovered into the killing zone we had established in front of the rift. As a group, they began levitating toward various vehicles and rocks as if examining them. No attention was spared for their inactive brother. Now that I had some idea of which part I was aiming for, I intended to take one down with just a few shots. Studying the tunnel the six spheres had bored through the debris, Caecilia looked to the riftlooked to the sphereslooked to the riftlooked to the spheres and dropped her hand. As synced as the spheres, the nine of us opened fire all at once. I watched carefully for the impact of my shots and downed one with Flavia's help; the Dangerous Four took out one each with their assault rifles, and Porcia, Septus, and Rufus sustained pistol fire on the last until it finally gasped, burped out organs, black smoke, and machine partsand bounced to the asphalt dead. Breaking cover and running to the pile, Caecilia attempted to push a boulder over and re-seal the hole, but a long black blade shot out and nearly skewered her. Retreating, she shouted, ""Fire at will!"" Piercing the exit with the sheer hatred of my gaze for all that had been lost in this strange disasterwhether it was the fault of these orbs or notI gladly joined in filling that tunnel with hot lead. Sphere after sphere ruptured and exploded at its exit; the crescendo of our rifles and pistols was punctuated by whirring machine death cries. Rufus shouted over the gunfire. "" Seal them in with their own corpses!"" Beside him, Septus reloaded with a whoop. Porcia ignored both of them, instead keeping perfect focus on the enemies. It was working. The tunnel became increasingly filled with debris from broken spheres, enough that the rest were having trouble getting through. Flavia reloaded, but waited with a tense expression. ""What is it?"" I asked her. The grey wave had washed away her cap, and, under the orange-blue evening sunlight, her dirty golden hair now glimmered somewhat less for all the caked dust. That marred beauty seemed to match her undermined confidence. "" Do you hear that? They're drillingbut I don't see where."" I realized it, too. We watched in dismay as six new holes were kicked out of the debris and spheres began emerging far more rapidly. Their assault rifles were now doing the bulk of the work, but, by Caecilia's expression, I knew that she knew that we couldn't hold. Leaping up, she shouted, ""Fall back!"" We ran, not as a destroyed rout, but as a solid nine-man unit. In our own kind of gun-bearing phalanx, we kept the approaching tide of spheres at bay, managing to protect ourselves while their greater numbers spread out into the fractured forests. ""How many did you see?"" her brunette teammate asked again, this time demanding an answer. As she led the way over a humongous stretch of upended clay, Caecilia answered with humorless doom, ""Between fourteen- and thirty-thousand."" She
She hadn't told us
because we would have retreated. We would have run earlier. What use was slaying one sphere? Or the hundred-odd we had managed to take down? There were tens of thousands behind those, and she had known the whole time! In that instant, I hated her for her command decision, even though I knew it had been correct. Our blockade had delayed the spheres some number of minutes, and every single second counted. We were nearly out of ammunition now and our survival was likely forfeit, but in trade for our lives we had bought New Rome nearly forty five minutes. Forty five minutes. As the purpling evening sun darkened behind clouds of black spheres spreading out in every direction, I pulled Flavia over the high angle at the top of the wave-deposited clay ridge. "" A sphere hovered close, and she turned and shot it twice; part of its exterior broke off, but she saved her last bullet, not daring to waste it. The sphere put forth a drill and began advancing. From behind, Septus slammed down with a rock and finished the work she had begun. Wild-eyed, and with Porcia and Rufus in tow, he clambered over the ruined machine and after us. Ahead, a roar of resurrection and a blast of light in the death-cloud-cast darkness marked the rebirth of a delivery truck engine; Caecilia ordered us to grab sticks and rocks as weapons and then climb aboard. The front of my uniform was beginning to grow wet from blood leaking from my head and cheek, but I fought off wooziness and kept my heavy branch held ready. Through a small window from the cabin where she and the leg-wounded man sat, our leader shouted, ""Draw their attention any way you can! Keep them approaching our rear!"" Indeed, it was a sort of mobile chokepoint. The flat roof and sides of the delivery truck were not interesting to the spheres, so the bullet or two we used to draw the attention of the portion of the swarm behind us brought them surging at the open slamming doors at the back. Standing shoulder to shoulder, we bashed and crushed over and over again as they approached; some of us crouched down and defended our feet, while others swiped at any orbs that tried to slip in between our heads and the ceiling. Even luckier, the enemy machines bumped and collided with each other as they tried to keep up with our high speed and debris-dodging swerving. Would this actually *work?* The black-and-gold suited brunette called up, ""They're not using swarm dynamics!"" The man in the passenger seat of the cabin repeated her words, and Caecilia called back, ""Are you certain?"" What had she meant by that? Watching my enemies as they pushed forward, I realized that there was something ungainly and ungraceful about these monstrous machines. They didn't flow together like birds did in the sky; they didn't coordinate easily and automatically by following the unit ahead of them. In fact, the more there were, the less effective any single orb seemed to be. That mirrored something I instinctively recognized. "" They're not independent!"" I shouted, gripping my cheek and nearly passing out from the pain as I did so. The brunette affirmed my realization. "" Something is controlling them from afarsomething on the other side of that rift, no doubt."" Caecilia didn't have time to continue our analysis; she and the man up front had been forced to start expending the last of their assault rifle ammunition as the swarm became an eerily silent cloud of dark blots around us. And, step by step, we were being forced deeper into the truck. Drills began shooting sparks from the sides and ceiling, and a blade or two stabbed through at length. I fell due to a bump in the road and avoided the first, but a followup slashed my left sleeve, and a third skewered Rufus through the lower abdomen. Porcia screamed with anger and broke the blade off with her heavy rock; our red-haired teammate grimaced and retreated behind us, his back now up against the little window to the cabin where staccato gunshots echoed rapidly. After taking a shoulder stab herself, Flavia followed to help defend him against incidental attack. That was the real enemy. I was tired. I had been exhausted before this had even begun, and now I was bone-weary. I was moving ineffectually and reacting slowly, and I knew it was only a matter of time until I fell. The black-and-gold suited man to my right pushed me back. "" You're done! ""But""
He shoved me hard, and I fell next to Rufus and Flavia, who held me down and insisted I listen. Septus and Porcia tried valiantly to help in the defense, but numerous little slices along their arms and legs began adding up, and a drill coming up from the floor pierced Porcia's foot, ending her run. At the last, it came down to Septus alone guarding us four casualties in the very back; we watched in amazement as, beyond him, the two standing members of the Dangerous Four used the new spacenow that we were out of the wayto engage in a graceful tandem dance of destruction. The man took to swinging his metal rod this way and that, rupturing sphere after sphere; his brunette teammate dodged around him, drawing attention from the orbs breaking in through holes in the walls and ceiling while crushing any that got through with her heavy rock. All this they pulled off while the truck swerved dramatically left and right to avoid unseen obstacles at high speed; all this they did with fury in their eyes. These truly were the best of the best, and I understood now why they were so highly regarded. But there were just too many. The only light now was a small rectangular beam leaking in through the cabin window from the reflected headlights; I steeled myself and prepared to join Tacitus. Without so much as a horn of retreat, the cloud of spheres suddenly pulled up and away. Opening my eyes, I found myself on the back of an open and flat truck bedthe rear had been entirely ripped apart and cast aside piece by piece. The two elites stood steaming like fire elementals, breathing hard and casting their expert eyes about in search of further enemies. They were exhausted like us, I knew, but they had some sort of inhuman second level of endurance in which they burned their very life force to keep alert and fighting. Walls suddenly shot past, and I realized where the orbs had gone. We had reached the city limits, and they were surging up in thick black rivers to get a better vantage point. Like vast horrible fingers they were, or arms spreading out to grip New Rome, and I could almost see the intelligence behind them at work in that reaching grasp. I looked at my watch: only seventy two minutes had elapsed since the warning call had gone out. We could not count on the military to be present and ready. The streets and buildings here formed canyons whose piled industrial debris completely blocked the way by truck. As we came to a stop, I stared to my left and right at the dark maws of broken windows and shattered doors. The contents within were not entirely ruined, for the flood had been dry, rarer than water, and had come and gone quickly; the damage seemed more akin to an earthquake and a hurricane than an apocalypse. No, the end of the world would be from these spheres, not the strange flood and wave. We slowly climbed down from the ruined truck and took our first steps on the shattered glass and loose rubble of New Rome's surviving remains. After finishing relaying everything we had learned over the radio, Caecilia looked up at the circling black swarms and then turned to us. "" Most of the other rifts have been successfully defended, but guns aren't going to solve this one. The higher-ups have a plan, a last ditch effort, and I think it will workat a great cost. We were too weak to talk, so Septus responded for us: ""Go?"" ""Go find your loved ones,"" the leader of the Dangerous Four told us. "" If you can. Time is short."" She moved and motioned, and her three teammates began climbing over the downed building blocking the road. "" Be safe, fellow officers. Survive this."" When they were over the top and out of earshot, Porcia said bitterly, ""We've been left behind because we would have held them back."" Rufus lowered his head; Septus grunted; Flavia just helped me stand, and together we began staggering in a direction we knew well. ""Where are you going?"" Porcia called. "" You aren't leaving us behind too, are you?"" As she held me up, Flavia looked me in the eyes, glanced down at my open cheek, and then turned back to yell, ""We're going to see our grandfather."" I shook with pain and utter exhaustion, but I still managed to smile at that. My grandfather had often insisted my sister in arms was part of our family, but she had always politely refused out of respect for memory of her mother and grandmother. But she had not added the part that resounded in my thoughts a heartbeat later: *if he still lives.* Rufus and Septus studied the mood of the clouds of black dots high in the sky. "" How do you evaluate it?"" the red-haired said to his ally in the formal tongue. The youngest son of his family responded, ""We are duty bound to protect them."" Informally, he added: ""My older brothers are assholes anyway. Together, they lifted the sobbing Porcia between their shoulders and helped her avoid using her pierced foot. Happy that we were sticking together, I limped along beside Flavia until they caught up, and we weak and wounded five picked our way through alleys and over hills of rubble while staying out of sight of the ominous watchers above as best we could. By my watch, eighty five minutes had passed. If the spheres just took a little bit longer to evaluate the complex battlefield below them, there was a chance we could run out the clock, for they did not know there was a clock at all. We had no such fortune. As we neared Collis Oppidum, the ancient slum district in which I lived, I regarded the upward slope of the familiar long hill that usually meant I was nearly home, while, at the same time, I saw individual black dots descending from on high. Despite the difficulty and pain of talking, I said, ""They're doing it again."" Flavia asked, ""What is their strategy?"" ""Those are scouts,"" I told my worried teammates as we stopped and leaned in a huddle to keep from falling over. "" Just like before, they're sending individual spheres to analyze areas. With more focus, that single one is far more dangerous."" Heads nodded around me in the huddle. Septus asked, ""What do we have?"" Flavia responded, ""I've got one bullet. Anyone else?"" Nobody else. Rufus reached down and pulled at a jutting piece of rebar at our feet; failing that, he broke it off with a heavy rock. "" Everybody get a metal rod. It's quicker than a rock and more effective than a branch."" Wearily, we followed suit, breaking weapons out of the shattered foundation of the building on which we stood. Porcia suggested, ""Let's stick to alleys and out of sight."" As one, we five breathed in, stepped carefully down high narrow alleys, and kept our eyes sharp. We were only four blocks away from the quarter of Collis Oppidum that held my home, but every heartbeat felt fraught with dangerand it was. As we approached a junction between four close ramshackle buildings, a long bladed spear shot out and sliced Flavia's midriff as she dodged back; four rods slammed down and broke that spike before following it back to its source and beating it to pieces. There was no more protection by stealth. We ran; even Porcia on her leaking foot. On each street and in each alley we encountered a sphere that had learned from each of its predecessors. The second tried to stay out of reach and stab at us from afar, but Septus ran up a debris slope, leapt, and slammed it down into our waiting mob. The third, lying in wait, had actually donned a sort of armor for itself by incorporating rubble into its makeup; with this one, we did rod-to-blade battle for three long and exhausting minutes that we could not afford. Septus took a stab to the thigh, and Porcia a rotating hammer-like appendage to the ribs, but I decided to mimic our opponent and adapt by using my rod as a spear instead of a club. Stabbing down with all my might, I penetrated just between pieces of rubble armor, and the sphere smoked and died with a fading scream. One more block. One more sphere. We found it waiting for us high up between two fire escapes; like an army not daring to leave a hostile castle behind them, it knew we would not just walk underneath it and let ourselves become surrounded if other spheres were ahead. It was practically inviting us to climb those fire escapes and do battle from either side at heights where its agravitational movement gave it an advantage. My cheek was numb from adrenaline and constant pain now, and I spoke freely: ""It's here."" Breathing hard beside me, her face covered in traces of blood and dirt and her blonde hair dark brown and grey from rubble-dust, Flavia asked in the formal tongue, ""Our enemy?"" I nodded. Whatever force it was that operated these spheres had turned its full attention on us, and I understood why: I had been the first contact, the first to fight back, and an ongoing resister. Even without drilling directly into our brains, it was *learning about us*, and it was entirely possible we had been permitted to survive this far so that the experiment could continue. It would have been a simple matter to smash a thousand spheres bodily down upon us like a hammer if the intelligence observing us had been so inclined. An antibody... this was how the immune system worked. Encounter a hostile organism, develop a defense, and then deploy it en masse. We were on that second step, and letting the enemy complete its research would bring down untold horrors upon us when the third step began. I put my hand out to my teammates to tell them what I had realized, but Flavia raised hers first. The sphere fell, broken, as her final bullet felled it. I turned and looked back at the city, now lit solely by a sliver of liquid orange sun peeking over the horizon, and now spread out before us because of our position on the high hill at its outskirts. The swarms above swirled faster, casting long animated shadows across the landand they began to descend like a horrible dome of night come early. The intelligence had learned enough from its various scouts throughout the city, and now it was going to cleanse us. ""* For the first time in my life, I did more than flirt with that second level of endurance whose mastery I had seen in my elite comrades. Death was upon us like a shadow out of the evening sun, and I wanted to see my grandfather one last time. I wanted him to know Flavia had accepted us. I wanted to drink tea. I wanted to curl up by his knees and hide against the coming darkness like I had as a child. His stories had always been inspiring, engaging, and even frightening, but they had never left me despairednot like this. With the frenzy of life nearing its end, I ran past the communal well and began tearing away the piles of wood that had buried the front door of my apartment. The slums were mostly made of wood rather than stone, and, paradoxically, that had left them far less damaged by their own partial collapse. High on the hill of Collis Oppidum, these buildings had taken a fraction of the grey wave's impact. Was it possible that my grandfather had survived? My four brothers and sisters pulled at the debris with fire to match my own, but because of the descending cloud of death above us. Crawling in the small hole we finally managed to open, I slipped into the first room of my two-room apartment, pulled my flashlight off of my belt, and marveled that everything was still in its place and tidy. Running to the back room with a hopeful grin, I came up short, and my excitement faded. My grandfather lay unmoving on the floor with his eyes closed. My flashlight illuminated piled wood on the other side of our apartment's sole window. He'd been buried here all alone, with no way out and no place to find breath. I dropped to my knees as my friends surged in behind me and then fell silent. ---

Spoiler: gt;!This is a tragic update! lt; Trigger Warning: gt;!Suicide! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/ThrowRAihatemymom](<URL>) **Mom(40F) cheated on Step-Dad(45M) and ruined my(16M) and my siblings' lives** I am a 16 years old male. I have 2 sisters (10F,8F). Our biological father was never in our lives. He left my mom when she was pregnant with me, came back 6 years later and said he wanted to make amends and that we could be a happy family. Somehow my mom immediately started saying that she loved him but he left after mom got pregnant again. Then 2 years later he came back, I cried and begged my mom to not let him into our lives because I hated him. Well, he said the same thing, my mom also said she loved him and then he left after she got pregnant again. My mom was a waitress so the 4 of us lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I was essentially another parent to my sisters because mom was always working. Sometimes, we wouldn't eat breakfast or dinner because we couldn't afford it. Other times, I did not eat anything so that my sisters could eat. My mom met another man (45M) a year after my youngest sister was born. He is a really good man. His wife and daughter had died in an accident a long time ago when he was in his 20s. He met my mom when he was ready to date again. He is a really good man and treated us like his own children and I consider him my father. He was very wealthy and owned multiple businesses. We eventually moved into his huge mansion like house. I also had a better school there. We 3 siblings got our own rooms and I got better clothes, played video games for the first time in my life and a bunch of other things. He taught me things, helped me catch up in school because I could not do well in the previous school. He spent a lot of time with the 3 of us. My sisters eventually started calling him ""dad"". I followed shortly after. I remember him crying, hugging us and telling he loved us when we called him dad for the first time. They eventually got married and dad asked me to be one of his groomsmen and of course, I said yes while my sister were my mom's bridesmaids. Mom stayed at home to take care of us. As far as I know, they were very happy together. They went on dates at least once in 2 weeks, kissed each other frequently and always told each other that they loved each other. He also knew about mom's past and realized she had issues and got her into counselling. I was really happy that my mom had finally found someone who treated her well. I was also very happy for myself and my siblings and really loved him. He also said that he would pay for college for the 3 of us. My dream is to become a doctor and I never thought it would be possible cause it was so expensive so and I was so freaking happy. Mom also told me she was very lucky to have found him and that she loves him and is very grateful of how he has made her and our lives better. Well, last year July dad discovered that my mom was having an affair with his best friend who was also the best man at their wedding. Apparently, the affair was going on for a long time, I do not know exactly how long. Mom cried and begged him to give her another chance. He didn't, understandably. He let us keep all the new things such as clothes for me and toys for my sisters. When I went to him crying and asking him why he was leaving us he just hugged me and told me about mom's affair. He said the affair is too painful and that he cannot be in this marriage anymore and then said that he loved me and my sisters. My sisters do not know about the affair, I do not think they will understand. He got a prenup so mom did not get anything that wasn't hers. Dad just had to pay the rent of a new apartment until the divorce was finalized. We stayed in a decent apartment but after the divorce was done we moved into a much smaller apartment. I tried to be in contact with him but it does not seem like he wants a relationship with me. He has never responded to my messages. I sent a final letter to him last year December thanking him for everything he did for me and my sisters and that I loved him and would remember him forever. So now we're back to a one bedroom apartment, skipping meals and barely being able to afford anything. I sleep on the floor now. My sisters share a bed while my mom uses another. Mom is a waitress again. I've also taken a part time at a grocery store to help with money. I just hate my mom so much right now. I only took the job to help my sisters. I have also stopped talking to mom. Recently she came crying to me and told me that she was sorry for ruining everything and she wanted me to talk to her. I broke down and just said ""I don't understand. Why did you cheat on him? He was taking such good care of you and the 3 of us. He was also gonna send us to college. For the first time in my life, I was happy. You have destroyed my life. Why do you always have to ruin everything? You already did that twice when you let \[bio father\] back in my life. I hate you. I never want to talk to you again"" She was crying a lot after I said that. I am gonna admit, what I said was pretty rude but at that time I was just so angry. I just hate her so much right now. I just wish she dies a very painful death. These thoughts are the only things in my head. It's making me go insane and I know it's not normal. I read online that therapy would be useful but we can't even afford food on most days so we don't have insurance. All I can think about is how she ruined everything. He didn't even ask for much. Mom was living such a luxurious life and was just at home taking care of her own biological children. I just miss him so much. Even my sisters keep asking when they are going back home or when they'll see dad again. They've also started crying and asking for dad a lot of times this past year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so frustrated and just angry at everything. I wish I could run from here but if I did who would take care of my siblings. That stupid mother can't do shit. I guess I'm here cause I need some help. I don't really know what to do. Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything. Other days I just wished I died and all of this ended. [UPDATE](<URL>) **My Mom(40F) Committed Suicide Because Of Me(16M)** Hello everybody. This is a throwaway account. About 2 weeks ago, I found my mom dead in our house. She had sent my siblings (10F,9F) to their friend's house and then hung herself. She really changed after she got divorced from my step dad after she cheated on him (I made a post about it recently). My mom and I didn't talk a lot after that. One of the last things I told her was that I hated her and asked her why she ruined my and my sisters' lives. I wish I didn't say that. Maybe she would have been alive if I supported her. I have had no contact with my step dad after the divorce. My sisters and I live with my mom's sister and her husband now. We never met them before this and even my mom never had contact with them but they are the only family that could be found and they agreed to let us live with them. My siblings and I don't like living here. Both of them are constantly shouting at each other and at us. We're just so uncomfortable here. I don't think they can afford food for all of us. I have a job at a grocery store so I mostly buy food for my siblings. My boss is also very nice and allows me to take home some extra things for free. I really miss my mom. My sisters are also always crying for her. She had her flaws but I still love her. She's my mom. The last thing I told her was that I hated her. I just wish that I told her that I love her and supported and helped her. Then she would've been alive today. What I told her tipped her over the edge. I can't do any of this anymore. I just don't know anything anymore.",I am so frustrated and just angry at everything.,5948,0,1

I am so tired of being tossed around from specialist to specialist like a damn potato. It's like every one of them is going ""Not it! You touched it last!"". I am beyond ready for one of those fucks to just give me a damn prescription for tramadol already. But like you were saying, it just doesn't work that way.

It would be nice to be able to go to the store or even take a shower though. I know tramadol is still addictive and blah blah withdrawal and so on. But I would much rather have a physical drug dependency and a life than constant intolerable pain and no life. Also, it doesn't even get me high! Which is totally cool. Did I mention that I'm 23?

Hi guys, been doing etizolam once(yes I'm sure, no redosing was occurring) daily for 7 weeks. Usually 2-3mg a day but two days were 10mg and one day I did 20mg, those three days were the only days I dosed more than once. Currently taking 2mg a day for past week, few hours before bed, am using to help sleep, during pandemic finding my depression is worse and is harder to sleep. I sleep like a baby after a few mg of etizolam. I'm assuming I should not stop cold turkey at this point? Would tapering schedule is recommended or cold turkey for this use time? Some people seem to play the long game on the taper and some play the short game. Since I haven't been using long would it be logical to go short here? Like next week go to 1.5mg then next week 1mg then half mg next week then done? Edit: didn't dose last night. Didn't sleep much. Felt like chest was caving in most of the night. No chest pains this morning though. Feel rough and low on sleep and irritated but will probably get through this. I Intend to drink myself to sleep tonight. Cold turkey looks like it was the right call so far, thanks guys! Edit #2 so made it to day 6. No relapse, and also very little sleep. The lack of sleep is starting to get to me. If I do relapse I feel as it will be the lack of sleep that gets me to do it. I don't always make the best decisions when I'm tired. But, so far so good. Edit #3 so last night, night 7 is what I would call my first good night of sleep since quitting. It still wasn't great sleep but was good and the first time I was able to get more than a hour and half of deep sleep in a night since stopping which really helped. Edit #4 hopefully final edit. So I think I'm back to normal, after day 9 I started sleeping normally, good amount of deep sleep and woke feeling good. And after a few days of good sleep I think it's behind me.

We are not really dating anyway, we are basically ""best friends"" but the small difference is that we agreed on an official relationship. That doesn't mean much, it **doesn't mean there is alot of romance or anything sexual**. She lives her own life and I'm not too involved with her anyways. And no, **I do not want her to move to my country**. I did first but I realized it was a mistake. She is too young for such decision so I really don't want her to do that. About the 5 years age gap, you can have your opinion that it is too big, but I simply disagree and you really don't have to hate me for not sharing your opinion. If I am a 40 year old man dating a 10 year old child, that would be a big issue, but cmon 21 and 16 is not an extreme difference **especially because I do nothing sexual or weird with her.** You may think it's a too big gap, but since that is your opinion and it also isn't an extremely big gap, you should really not show so much hate to me. We simply disagree about something small. Pedophilia is disgusting and I am against it. Because I'm not one of them.",I do NOT have any sexual desires with my girlfriend.,453,1,1

That being said, I've always been really stressed but developed an anxiety disorder during my junior year and failed out of my program. I transferred to another program in school and was doing well..till now. I tried to take on a heavy course load to make up for the time I've been out of school dealing with anxiety. I was supposed to graduate in 5 weeks. Once again, anxiety reared its ugly head and screwed things up for me. I'm going to probably get a C in a class (Probably) and my GPA just can't handle that. Everyone is telling me to drop it and retake it in summer when I have more time to dedicate to it and I'm not taking 20 credits. I could do that but I'm SO SO SO scared what grad schools are going to think of me.

I need to make a decision by the end of tomorrow and I'm just FREAKING OUT. I can't concentrate on homework at all. Either risk it and possibly get a C or B. Or just withdraw and definitely get a B or higher in summer. I'm so bummed about not graduating in 5 weeks. I feel like I've come so far with my anxiety and now I'm being set back again.

s_481_30,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"[17/m] I'm in a triangle with two friends and it's driving me insane, would love some advice :) So I've been friends with this girl I really like, and long story short, I really think I love her. I know it sounds stupid af, but just hear me out. I've never even tried to be in love because I'm so scared of a broken heart. Then she came along, and we became friends. We hang out a lot after school and text. We even have the gold heart thing on Snapchat. It sounds cringy, I know, just hang in there :D
On Snapchat, she sends me pictures where she clearly poses and takes the time to make them look good. Some of my friends actually thinks we're dating, but we're not. I say some because I think she likes another guy, and he happens to be my close friend. While she acts like she likes me (she must just be really polite idk), she's more physical with him (he sits in her lap and sleeps on her shoulder). I've also seen her drawings of him playing the piano (she's a really good artist). He's a really good guy, and if there is a thing between those two, I would hate to be a jerk to either of them and get in the way. We're both (the other guy and me) really good at the piano and we both play video games. I guess I have more in common with her than he does cuz we (the girl and me) love to write and watch anime (the other guy doesn't do either). All three of us are pretty weird though even though we're all well liked as people at school. The problem is that I actually really like her. I've never felt this way with anyone and I sometimes feel like I'm accidentally gonna blurt out ""I love you."" This whole unofficial love triangle has been going on for months now, and it's driving me insane. The one time I actually feel emotionally invested in someone, I know it's just a dead end because I have a long history of losing. The other part of me wants to desperately win because I don't think I'll ever find someone quite as unique as her. I might get close and I might find other unique people, but she's special. Bottom line, I think I'm being led on, and she's going to eventually fall in love with him. I'm just so freaking terrified by this because I know it's going to break my heart. And isn't that why I never tried to get close with a girl before? I have planned my final attempt. If this doesn't win her heart, then I'm dropping it, and I'll deal with the sadness. I wrote her a song that's not specifically addressed to her, but she'll realize at the end who I'm referring to. I already booked a slot in the upcoming Valentine's Day assembly at school so I'm pretty set on doing this. Other than that, do you think that I should just drop it? If so, if you could give me some coping mechanisms to deal with the pain, that would be awesome. Thanks, and you're the best :)

Not the run around in circles and fight people kind, the cantstopfidgetingohmygod kind. My mom worked in education and decided to have me observed by the school. They tell her it's because I have ADHD. So she takes me to therapy but tries to weasel her way into every appt. The therapist realizes this and starts asking me ""you're big enough to have this appointment alone, right?"" And I would always nod and my mom would always do and say awful things to try to get me to fess up as to what I had told the doc. I think she was taking me for appearances, and to tell the therapist that I was just acting up for her, as she did and does often. She kind of realized that taking me might backfire because the therapist wasn't an idiot. Guess who magically got better and didn't have to go to therapy anymore? And then when I was still hyped out of my mind and couldn't write a single sentence without wanting to die, she would say I was just being lazy/whiny and being bad. She would say that I did it at home too, but only when I had to actually focus and do things but that she was sure I was faking it. The other teachers at my school, where she worked, believed her. Son of a bitch. Later, when I was 11 and already showing signs of depression, she would scream at me for crying or for not being cheerful about some bullshit that I hated or for not immediately praising her for things. When I really started to retreat into my room more, she would yell that I deserved to be there anyway and I could stay there until I grew up and got a better attitude. I was self harming by 13 and miserable and she didn't give a shit. I was in an awful place by the time I was 13, but I kept up appearances alll the way until Junior year. I was in clubs, on teams, I was doing just okay in classes. Then I crashed. I failed all of my classes and they made me go to a special school where I could make it up. I knocked two years of classes out in six months. Without a full class of people, I could focus! I could go outside and do my work and finish a weeks worth in an hour and a half! I went back to regular school with enough credits that I could have already graduated, but I wanted to go to prom and stuff so I went back. My mom had zero interaction with this school. But the weird thing is she would tell me how proud she was of me for working hard to make it up. She almost never put me down for being in that school. The ONE thing she should have gotten mad about. W
So here's where it gets funny - she used to kick me out allllll the time. For various infractions. I think I was 14 the first time this happened. And then she'd call and beg me to come home and say she was sorry, and I was a fucking idiot doormat so I'd walk home with my tail between my legs and she'd cry and hug me and then the next day she'd be yelling again. ( Guess who's bipolar? But that's actually only a little relevant.) She would tell everyone at school that she didn't know what was going on with me, that I'd just disappear sometimes and not answer the phone and wouldn't tell her where I was going. School counselor called me in. By this time my mom didn't work for the district anymore and had switched careers. This counselor, who had already thought I was lazy and awful for having to go to the other school, mostly ignored me when I told her my mom was actually kicking me out and had hit me several times in the past and committed abuse by taking away ""privileges"", some as easy as TV and some like ""laundry and shower"". Didn't care. Thought I was acting up. Enter - me, 19. I am flunking my second semester of college after barely scraping by in the first. I hate college. I feel like an idiot and I'm not as put together as these other people. I flunk out and start working. I meet my FH just before I turned 21 and moved into his place 2 weeks later. His roommates all bail. In the interim, we have to find a place to stay. Guess who has the only open room in town? At least FH got to experience how she treated me. She only did it when she thought he wasn't there, but he's quiet. He saw and heard everything. We move out again. At that point, I'm 23 and completely unsure if I was actually ill or if she'd twisted it all up. It takes me two years to get help because A: I am scared and B: it takes me that long to actually call the abuse what it was. Turns out I'm not only ADHD and have full on depression, but I also have a panic disorder and show many signs of PTSD! I don't obviously tell her any of these. In the last two years, she has started pretending we have a great relationship now and she's always talking about how I'm ""sooo much better after getting help"" and that I was a terrible and difficult child to raise because of my ADHD and mood issues.

The reason why I feel like the poor should have access to more is to ensure that their kids have access to everything they would need to bring themselves into a similar situation. You seem to have this idea that if we can not provide them with a similar experience to what people would pay for that we shouldn't even try to give them anything. I see that as just giving up. We have data and studies that the income/wealth gap is widening each year. The system (capitalism) is designed to widen the wealth gap. Capitalism with or without a govt overlooking it will eventually end up in a situation like we see today where 1% of the population owns a majority of the wealth.

Update I recieved the go ahead and approval for the post and the next one. I will post about regaining sensitivity and resetting triggers to something more innocent for those in the preteen and Teen age group. This one will be labeled NSFW Thread three will be a Misc. thread that covers things such as haircuts, clothing, eyelashes, etc. Hi there, You can call me Jimmy (Not my real name but a nickname after Jimmy Neutron because I was so smart as a kid and everyone called me that). I am 11 years old. I was diagnosed with Aspergers at 11 years old which is coincidence. Like many of you I really am mentally and emotionally that young. And I do experience body dysphoria and if I were to be given the opportunity to jump back into my 11 year old body permanently I would jump at it. However I am not suicidal about it as I am more the type to do something about it for myself and others And I value my own life to much to ever consider it. And I don't mean advocacy as that is better left to those who dedicate everything to it. I mean real Actionable things you can do right now to keep yourself looking younger and closer to your real age. And I don't mean makeup. ( Barring some blush on the cheeks for the older among us.) I wont lie some of this costs money, some of it a lot of money. Some of it is free and some of it can be risky. But for the youngest in body among us it could be the only way of keeping their dysphoria in check semi permanently. I will put warning next to anything potentially dangerous and the money needed if applicable and most of it will only apply to the US. It will range from rejuvenating your body, some of these will have permanent consequences so you must be absolutely sure you could not live without it. I wont lie without knowing about this topic in detail I had fantasized and looked into halting puberty at that age with no feasible options and no money if I had known about what I am going to tell you about I would have jumped consequences or not. I will also put sources for those that have them and I will update this list as new information appears or community members have things to add that would compliment things. So please comment if you have anything to add. Now we start with the section that while dicey in places will greatly benefit the physically youngest among us. I will not lie your on a time limit and a very restrictive one as every pubertal change is not something easily reversed. It is also understandable that many of you will simply not have the capital available. Seemingly at least. But there are things you can do and they will serve you well and many will be permanent. However, you must first be absolutely sure that you are age dysphoric and that it will kill you inside to not look at or close to your true age. As until regenerative medicine progresses further these changes will be permanent and irreversible. Talk to a Psychologist first and keep this in your back pocket but make sure as you are a child. In many cases both physically and mentally. It will be significantly easier for you if you have your parents and psych on your side. As you won't have to go to cloak and dagger route and agonize on how to pay for things. Broach the idea slowly and carefully leverage your autism diagnosis if you have it. Make it abundantly clear that you will be destroyed if you physically grow up but don't get too whiny about it make your case that you already feel dysphoric in your body as it gets older and does not match your mental age. Bargain if you need to, make it clear that you're still going to study and put your best foot forward to get a job. If at any point unless your autism is that severe you make it known that you want to be taken care of like a child beyond love and affection your attempt will sour as many parents don't want that kind of burden. Remember it is more important that you keep your body looking how it should look. This way you can go through with the steps I'm going to list below but with parental approval and backing and hopefully a physician's supervision. You could even use the surprisingly low price as a selling point. If at the point you put your feelers forward you can see it would never be approved of or they would do horrible things to you, you will have to go to cloak and dagger route this is easier than it seems. The hardest part of the whole thing is getting a hold of the money. You can make this money by hopefully doing household chores and saving up as the first step will not take a lot of money. Otherwise you can perform a side hustle or ask around your neighborhood if anyone needs any chores done. You Will only need around $30 dollars on a visa gift card for this one and a safe place to send it to. Or better yet as part of your chores start bringing in the mail. This will give you chance to hide what you bought and use it later. When you've decided you've reached old enough what is the first thing on your to do list? Closing Bone Growth Plates. Girls have the short stick on this one is their growth finishes earlier than boys. With most reaching adult height at around 15. So the earlier the better for this one. Boys have a bit more leeway but the sooner it is done the younger you will look. There are two moderately safe ways to close the growth plates. High doses of estrogen or testosterone. An easily attainable way to do this is by taking a large and measured dose of birth control. Even the boys though you may have to worry about growing breasts if you continue doing so. If you have the option to though it might be more expensive it will be much better in the long term take the testosterone option instead. A very high initial dose will close the growth plates. Certain SARMS will also do so. But if you are low on time and money you need to take what you can get. [ <URL>](<URL>) You can get all of this from alldaychemist 2. Puberty Blockers and Anti Androgens: If you've gotten to this point hopefully you have your parents support as then you will be able to pursue the most ideal option which is an implant called ## [SUPPRELIN LA](<URL>) It will completely suppress puberty for at least one year. Without more permanent and damaging ways of preventing puberty this is the most sustainable and long term solution. With luck you can pretend to be gender dysphoric and just say you need time, that way the doctors will not only go out of their way to prescribe it for you but insurance just may cover it. Otherwise if you are very understanding doctors you may be able to get it anyways. Avoid Lupron though as the long-term side effects are coming out as very bad. If you are unable to get a hold of the other puberty blockers you may have to go the anti-androgen route. There is a tab dedicated to it on all day chemist. You can find Sarms on Science. Bio but expect to spend at least 70$. There is a possibility the implants can last for more than one year which would be even better. [ <URL>](<URL>) If you are able to do both of these things, you should basically be set. If you are already older than your real age at least you can prevent any more damage. For the older ones among us. Now we start with the first thing that will actually rejuvenate your skin and make you look physically younger. This will be expensive up front but the cost will lessen after the initial investment as you will only need to purchase certain items occasionally. Skin Care Shopping List and Rationale: 1:) Tretinoin : This is the most important part of the regimen, if you purchase nothing else or can afford nothing else this is what you should buy. It is one of the most scientifically studied skincare ingredients with decades of research outside of cosmetic companies. It is not a magic cure but over the course of several months of consistent application it will reduce and eliminate skin blemishes and wrinkles and help prevent the formation of new ones. Put a pea-sized dab on your face before you go to bed. Source Alldaychemist around 8$ per tube no prescription needed. Since starting to apply it my nascent frown lines have halfed. 2:) Skin Medica TNS recovery complex: This is the second most important part of the regimen. It is also the most expensive. It is a solution of over 300 growth factors and cytokines taken from human fibroblasts and is proven when applied over the course of around six weeks to double skin thickness and further reduce and eliminate wrinkles. Since starting to apply this my cheeks have gotten a little bigger and my eyelids have begun to look Dewey again. It is applied twice a day once at night and once in the morning and the single bottle will usually last 2 to 3 months. You may feel a slight burning sensation applying it after tretinoin. You should wait 30 minutes after applying tretinoin to apply this. These two are the only to you needed night. Source: Various sources Skin Medica. Price $60-200 Be careful of scams if going for the cheaper option. It should smell odd and a little organic or it is not real. 3:) Sunscreen: It should be Zinc Oxide and titanium Based. Source Various Price Various. 30-50 SPF 4:) AHA Cream: Morning exfoliation, in studies is proven to accelerate the the results of tretinoin as it operates by a different mechanism. Should be applied in the morning. Price various source various. 5:) Vitamin C Cream: This one should be simple, mono ingredient, and cheap. Apply after AHA and before sunscreen. 6:) Silk Pillowcases: As you get older you iron in wrinkles as you sleep on your side and your collagen production gets weaker. Cotton also sucks out the moisture from your face. The only thing proven in studies to not cause ironed in wrinkles is silk. You can also buy a silk eye mask. I myself use the one from Manta. Word of caution it should be silk not satin, this distinction is very important it should say only one hundred percent silk. 7:) A simple lotion for your body. I use Lush Cosmetics solid body lotion myself. Cost $12 8:) a simple body retinoid. I myself use something called retinoil which is $20. This will fade imperfections in your body. I am still trying to find something that will further fade white stretch marks and I will update this if I can. You can find this at your local drugstore usually. 9:) The last thing for skincare and the one that should only be used when you have discontinued the retinoids or anything that could make you more sensitive to light. Also the thing that could help a lot of us the most. I am talking about laser hair removal or any form of permanent hair removal. A lot of my discomfort would leave me if I did not have to look at body and pubic hair. And I'm certain that a lot of you feel the same. This one can take multiple sessions and until recently left out those who were darker skinned and have lighter hair colors. More recent advancements have made it available for them to. However is expensive and requires multiple sessions. A more permanent but just as expensive and little more lengthy procedure is called electrolysis. This one kills the hair follicle. But it can be painful. The cost for this one can be iffy. You might have to game the system and pretend to have gender dysphoria to get hair removal covered by insurance. You're only half lying as you do suffer from dysphoria (unless you also suffer from gender dysphoria). Otherwise you are looking at a minimum investment of $2000 but it will be probably be closer to $6000 the good news is that this is basically a one time expense. Once it is done you at most have to perform some maintenance sessions every few months in certain areas but you may not have to do it all. Edit: (2/09/21) 10:) In addition to the retinoid for the body I have found one thing that is empirically backed for the fading of stretch marks. It is something called bio-oil. They have a website. Now we move on to health and Exercises: Little Boys and Girls are generally thin and limber. And if you were able to portray that image and demonstrate that ability you will be looked at as younger. Thin does not necessarily mean super skinny as if you are too thin you will look much older than you really are and cause severe health issues and damage to yourself that will make you look older. A notable example are some of the pictures you see of vegan men in San Francisco. A lot of them look like Holocaust victims and even though many of them are in their early 20s they look like they're in their 50s. For that reason unless you do it for religious reasons I cannot recommend veganism at all as none of their assertions about health hold up to scrutiny and the ""studies"" are often found to be fraudulent. Now if you were on a vegan diet for moral reasons I commend you but just know you are making things harder for yourself. Vegetarianism is doable but will require supplementation and Eggs. Most of us here seem to be on the autism spectrum. For that reason and it's 30 years of study despite its detractors I recommend you begin a gluten-free casein free diet. It helped clear up bowel issues I have had forever. And cleared up Acne I have had on my arms for as long as I can remember. Follow the caloric intake recommendation for your age and sex unless you are overweight. In that case you must operate at a caloric deficit. A good cookbook to follow is this one [<URL> amp;psc=1](<URL> amp;psc=1) I also greatly recommend the autism nutrition research Center Regiment. [ <URL>](<URL>) it can be expensive but it is research-based, and it is no more expensive than each of the ingredients purchased separately. Sleep: Little boys and girls have bed times. That means 9 o'clock sharp no exceptions. ( Unless you work) You should be getting the 10 hours of sleep your body demands. This means practicing good sleep hygiene such as taking your electronics out of your room buying and using bluelight glasses. Installing bluelight filters on your electronics. Combined with the skincare regimen above this should alleviate your dark circles which should make you seem younger. The idea that increase sleep lessons your lifespan has been disproven. Exercise: Little Boys and Girls Club are fit, thin and limber. Generally as well they have round perky bottoms and thin appendages. Depending on your build, getting too thin can actually be counterproductive and make you look older. I am not going to lie even if you do everything perfectly and manage to do everything I am listing and will continue to list your build will limit how young you can look. But You can optimize your physique to make yourself look younger. Everything should be mostly proportional, for example if you are big and bulky your arms and legs should be within the range of the rest your body. You should have muscle but it should not be well-defined, but you should also try to limit fat as much as you can but not too much as a small layer of fat can stand in for baby fat if controlled properly. It will take some doing but the ideal is to be proportional with a small layer of fat to create a slightly chubby childish look. That does not mean you should be chubby just that it should be look like you have baby fat. I mentioned it earlier one of the big things people overlook and will give you a way if nothing else does is your butt. Children almost universally up to the late teenage years have well-defined and rounded glutes. Some people would call this diaper butt even though no diapers are involved. This is especially true for boys, and is this perspective I'm speaking from. There are other guides for women but the ideal is you want to avoid making your thighs bigger while making your butt perkier. [ <URL>](<URL>) This website is a good place to start and is funnily enough aimed at women. Another place to look is a website and workout plan called autism fitness. Some of them are useless if you are not developmentally delayed enough for them but others are perfect for our purpose as our goal is to gain lean muscle and flexibility not bulk. For me personally I do bear walks, dead bugs, squats, sidesteps, glue bridges both weighted and unweighted, Russian swings, overhead band presses, and moderate weight bench presses. Ultimately the exercises that are perfect for you, you have to find in your own. There is a last exercise I can recommend to everyone that will definitely make you look younger and further reduce the appearance of wrinkles if you have them and prevent their appearance if you don't. It is called facial yoga. Basically it's an exercise routine for your facial muscles primarily your cheeks, this avoids the sunken look and if you start young enough or will you still have enough volume you can preserve and look much younger than you normally would even with the steps mentioned above. Combining these with some of the geroprotectors, research chemicals, and other substances in the next section and depending on how old you look you will be able to target a presenting age. Which while probably not your actual age should be significantly better than what you experience currently. Calm down look at yourself in the mirror and see what you can fix and change. How old will that make you look? Make that your target. For a lot of us that presenting age will be somewhere in your teens. Not ideal but significantly better than would be possible otherwise. For myself based on my old photos and what I currently look like in my early 20s I could easily shoot for and maintain the looks of someone who is 14. With a stretch goal if some of the things I am investigating pan out of 13 to 12. If I could make it to looking like I was 12 I would be within spitting distance of my actual age and I would be happy with it. But if it doesn't 14 will have to do. When I say 12 I mean what I look like when I was 12 same thing with 14. You could easily just say you're a tall kid. I will hopefully coin a phrase: Your Presenting Age Goal. The goal of looking as close to your true age as is feasibly possible. Geroprotectors and other research compounds: Geroprotectors are compounds that prevent and reverse aging in physical adults. They include peptides, regenerative medicine, and certain research chemicals and non-FDA approved pharmaceuticals which are safe and tested elsewhere. A big thing to look at are the Khavinson peptides. Many of them have studies behind them to present their efficacy and they were developed for the Soviet Union super soldier program which became defunct after the fall. If you have heard of elderly individuals having young blood plasma transfusions to be young again these peptides operate upon the same principle. They make your body repair itself. One in particular would be very important especially among those who have had a destroyed sleep schedule and want to present as younger. That is Endoluten the Pineal Peptide. This extends the telomeres of the body and more importanly fixes your circadian rhythms so you will fall asleep and wake up as a child with the falling of darkness and coming of day. Looks are only half the equation, the other half is how you outwardly present in one of the best ways to seem younger even if you don't look it is hyperactivity. For that reason the adrenal peptide GlandoKort also comes recommended as it will restore some of that hyperactivity. The only other two I would recommend as essential, depending on your individual needs of course is ventfort the blood vessel peptide. Increased blood flow to areas will not only make you more alert it will also make you look younger by renewing the blood supply in places and giving you that childish blush. And Sigumir the cartilage peptide. This will not only have an extremely positive effect in your skin but more importantly shore up your cartilage and allow you to increase your flexibility and further reduce the age you present as. [ <URL>](<URL>) I buy mine from here, but if you look you can find it elsewhere. Make sure to buy the Russian branding not the American branding as the 60 capsules only come with the Russian. Now we move on from generally safe peptides to the riskier research chemicals. This post as long as heck as it is so I will only list each chemical what it can do for you how it can make you present as younger and safety considerations. NSI-189: Your emotions will be more intense and much more like a child's, you may be mentally a child but your body's hormones may have ""matured"" out of that stage causing an emotional disconnect. It was investigated first as a smart drug by DARPA and is now being developed and marketed as an atypical antidepressant but it is not an SSRI. It will improve your memory and make it more like a child's as its primary mechanism of action is by increasing BDNF and increasing the size of the hippocampus. This one has been tested extensively and its effective dose is 40 mg increasing the dosage will not increase the effects it will actually lessen the effects. You can look up any contradictions in scientific studies performed upon this. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I currently take this one. 9-me-bc: As long as you don't do drugs you will take greater pleasure and every day things and will restore ""the magic"". Many of you probably were put on ADHD medication, this works by down regulating dopamine receptors. This research chemicals on the other hand has been found to regenerate them even dead ones. You only need to take it for at most six weeks and you will need to avoid the sun like a vampire or put on sunscreen in that time. But the results are completely worth it. If you search on Reddit you might find traces of it being viewed as neurotoxic. There is no evidence of this as all compunds in this class do not have the same effect. Preliminary in vitro testing actually shows a neuroprotective effect. Reputable source = [Science.bio](<URL>) I also took this one but only for six weeks to repair early damage of ADHD medication. Cerebrolysin: I recently learned that I suffered from trauma induced alexithymia. PTSD, depression, and other traumas are actually a form of brain damage. This Russian peptide medication is primarily prescribed for that purpose. It is very safe and is been in use for over 70 years and has more than 400 human studies in several hundred more on animals. Why haven't you heard about it than? Because none of the studies are in English and the FDA doesn't consider any study not done in English to be credible. ( Yes I am serious) I recently finished a 30 day regimen of Cerebrolysin for 30 days. It did three big things for me. It restored my ability to feel emotions though I still need to learn interoception skills I never learned. It further expanded my awareness of the world and of myself. And it reopened the development period allowing me to start recognizing facial micro expressions and other conversational nuances that were beyond me before. It is also what gave me the awareness to realize I was an 11-year-old flying by the seat of his pants and gave me the nuance to look back on some of my actions ""growing up"" in a new light. I had always sought to recapture my childhood and remained looking as young as possible. A lot of my past and current behavior started to make sense in hindsight and present more evidence that I was mentally 11 even if I was intellectually much older. The benefit of this is you will better be able to judge situations and physically and emotionally express yourself which will serve the purpose of making you seem younger and simultaneously more polite so even if the people you're talking to see through you they are more likely give you the benefit of the doubt. It is intramuscularly injected so you will need to take time to learn how to do it safely if you so choose. Remember there is no pressure and you can take or leave whatever I present to you. The only legitimate source in the West to buy it is Rupharma. For older individuals that are of course numerous hormonal and other interventions you can partake in but I will not list them as they are up to you. That is all I have for now. I hope it can help some people.

s_2237_1043,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"My best friend/wife killed herself 2 years ago and I wish my anger would go away. This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink. We will call her Jenny for this. When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend. My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off. I DID NOT have sex with her. I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time. I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time. My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend. I'm not stupid; they fucked. And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try. Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing. I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude. Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal. When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence. Sometimes objects would entrance her. She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty. All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time. Oh and don't forget the octopus hat. I loved her so deeply. In a non-romantic way. Jenny had problems in her past. Her family was not very supportive of her. I think they just didn't know what to do. Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so. The school didn't know what to do with her either. Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note. Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important. Jenny was highly, highly intelligent. She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could. Johnny Five seriously yo. Jenny had problems socializing with others. She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with. After a while Jenny lost her job. She was fired for poor customer service. After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills. And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her. I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance. So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse. I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance. And she agreed. So that is what we did. At first it was great. Jenny was excited about us moving. Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment. But she was okay with this. Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war. Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me. What would she do if I died? Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people? And the news kept getting worse. She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens. About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you. About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....
Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank. Her ability to absorb data was astounding. She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained. So all this dark bad news she absorbed. When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house. I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean. The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq. She continued to refuse to see a doctor. But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go. Oh my goodness the meltdowns. Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone. The government is listening. She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet. Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you. The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests. The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings. Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence. She should have been inventing fusion reactors....
But Jenny was also autistic. Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism. The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk. But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism. Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school. Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books. The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable. Jenny refused any type of medication. OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you. I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants. So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State. The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent. So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country. The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home. So I went. I was gone for about one month. The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown. Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her. This hurt so bad. I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains. She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! And then she hung up the phone. She had done this many many times before. Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards. So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny. The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state. The social worker was not answering her phone either. So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning. Jenny was still mad; not answering her phone. While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself? And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief. Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that. I loved Jenny so much. I just wanted her to be happy. To recapture that innocence and wonder she had. To live life without mistreatment from others. I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her. There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude. I interfered with one telling the customer to back off. Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me. Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors. That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor. Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello. I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start. So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got. No answer. But she's done this before. I kept telling myself she would be okay. But that evening, I could not take it anymore. So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her. The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone. He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there. I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house. He said okay and that he would call me back. Five minutes passed. A goddamn eternity it was. I called the cops phone. No answer. Ten minutes passed. Fucking cop won't answer the phone. Twenty minutes passed. Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone. So I call the neighbor. Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good. With that information I tell myself. Jenny is dead. Finally the cop calls. He says, I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead. She hung herself. The body is cold so we did not try CPR. An ambulance is on its way. We then hung up. I couldn't believe it. I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning. I thought somehow that is what caused this. Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything. She was my best friend. She was just an innocent bunny. I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house. And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet. And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash. Jenny hung herself with it. And then I wept some more for about an hour. Walking around the now empty house. I was abandoning it. I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time. So I let it foreclose. But anyway. I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall. I just wanted Jenny back. Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten. I cried like I never cried before. I was slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess. And then suddenly it stopped. And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny. And I'm still angry. It was just such a waste. She was so damn smart. Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries. And she just quit life like that. She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left. No note or anything left behind. What in the FUCK Jenny??????? And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it. I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore. And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now. My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines. But dammit I'm still so mad at her. I wish I could feel something other than anger. Because I loved her and now she's gone. She just fucking quit and left. So that's it. Its off my chest I guess. Not really. I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do. I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else. And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny. What the fuck? My prayer. TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy. :p. I asked nicely...
Edit: what's with all the fucking hate mail? I followed the doctors advice. I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her. I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry. I gave her everything she ever asked for and more. If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy. Grow some balls. (Wait no those are weak) grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man. Wait.... what? Edit2: writing this was incredibly therapeutic. It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go. I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet. I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments. I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be. But at least the heart squeezing is gone.

s_781_247,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Fear of failing. Ive dealt with the ups and downs of depression for over 20 years. But the last 6 or so months has been the most incredible roller coaster ride of emotions for me. From feeling absolutely rock bottom and ready to go to top of the world invincible. Early this year around the beginning of February I moved from Texas where I've lived 25+ years. A majority of my life. Currently 29. My gf at the time had kicked me out. Long story short, she was incredibly selfish and didnt have the time or patience to deal with someone with depression and anxiety. As I had no where else to go I ended up moving to Kansas to stay with my grandparents until I could get back on my feet. Ive had a few jobs while I've been here and it was never meant to be a permanant thing. There were weeks where I wanted to do nothing but lay in bed and just cry at what a failure I've been my entire life. Here I am almost 30 years old and I have practically nothing to show for it. Constantly thinking in the back of my mind it would be so much better to just give up. But I didnt. I only made one friend that I actually hung out with while I've been here and never had any intention of getting into a relationship with anyone until I got my self under control and moved on emotionally from my now ex gf. As of today, I havent spoken with my friend in a good month or two after we had a small falling out. I tried to make it clear that I wasnt looking for a relationship having moved here and was using this oppurtunity to work on myself get back on my feet and ready to move on from a broken relationship. That seemed to have backfired on me after we ended up sleeping together and I guess gave them the wrong idea. So I backed away and we havent spoken to each other since. My grandparents were kind enough to let me live with them for the good portion of this year and all I've managed to do is dig myself into hole after hole. They helped me get a car after I got a job. With the agreement that I keep up on my car payments and insurance. Ive fucked that up completely. When I first moved here I found a job working for a company I worked at back home. I got rides to and from work from my grandparents until I saved a bit of money to start looking for a car. My grandparents and I decided to go to carmax and get a reliable car riding on their good standing credit with them paying a decent down payment that I would repay them when I was able to. I soon left that job for a better job. About 3 months into the new job the stress started to get to me and I was having anxiety attacks at work lasting almost 3 hours. I had to leave. I got nothing but flak for quitting my job about how I shouldve found a job before leaving and so on. But the anxiety attacks stopped almost immediately after I left. My only thought at the time was Id rather get a little behind on bills than end up in the hospital for freaking out or something and hurting myself. After about 2 or 3 weeks of looking for a less stressful job and knowingly falling behind on my car payments I went and found a job working at Amazon here. Seeing as I had worked for them 2 years prior I knew I would have no trouble getting a job. But still my time was short. I had until the end of Sept to find a place to go regardless. It just seems like they wanted instant gratification and expected me to fix everything overnight. Even after I had explained no matter what approach I take it was going to take time and wasnt going to happen overnight. My grandma recently had to be hospitalized for a minor heart attack attributed to stress. Somehow I feel partly responsible and it makes me feel like a piece of shit. I gave my grandma a heart attack. But, I can honestly say the last 2 months I havent had one suicidal thought at all. Ive been in good spirits for the most part. I enjoy working at my job knowing my time was short and I would have to find somewhere to go. So here I am. Im moving this friday 3.5 hours away to the other side of Missouri to stay with someone I recently met. Someone who has shown me more love than all of the people in my life up to this point. I will have to find a job there as soon as I can. Behind on my bills. Very little money. With my grandma telling me if I miss one car payment I'm going to lose my car because she apparently cares more about her near perfect credit score than the well being of her eldest grandchild. Yet, I fear I am and will always be a failure. I fear I will never be in a place in my life where I am truly happy. No matter how hard I try or how far I get I fear Im always going to be held down and made to feel like nothing. The only thing I dont fear at this point is death.

s_3028_518,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"My OCD Story (A Journey into Scrupulosity) *Warning: Wall of text post here, but this is my story
I think a part of me died about six years ago. I could not tell you what happened in January 2009 that caused me to start hearing what I thought were voices in my head. I do remember the hours I would spend obsessing over what these voices said to me. I do remember the pain I felt when I butchered one of my ritualistic phrases and said that I ""worship the devil"" on accident. I do remember how I begged God and pleaded for Him to have mercy on my soul. The only thing I wanted was my sanity. --------
The voices did not stop. After awhile, the hope that was alive inside my body died. There was no place for me to confide. My parents emotionally abandoned me as a child. I always knew they were there for me when I needed to be controlled. If I ever forgot the rules, I knew they would remind me. As far as dealing with the wounds that life gave me, I was on my own. I stood alone. I stood in silence. I stood as a seventeen year-old boy who thought he was schizophrenic. I knew those voices were after me. I knew those demons were trying to kill my soul. I started waking up in the middle of the night because I needed to complete my rituals; I needed to defend myself from those voices. There were nights when I would toss and turn in my bed, begging for peace. I felt as if my soul was on fire. I was screaming through the flames and there was no one there to rescue me. There was no place for me to run. There was no way to escape my mind. ------
There was also no one for me to confess. There was no comfort for me. Here I was, left in this wilderness alone. I knew time was coming to an end, soon. I believed Jesus was coming back soon. It could be any day now. I did not understand why I had to lose my sanity and my salvation, this close to the end of the world. I tried to do everything right: follow all of the rules, go to Sunday school, love my neighbor, all of the Christian mannerisms. I did not know why God was mad at me, but I knew He was done with me. I accepted this as my hell bound fate and continued to wander the wilderness. --------
After four years of hiding in shame and suffering, I finally came out and told one of my close friends I thought I was schizophrenic. He encouraged me to go to the school counseling office at my university. I learned a significant amount about my past during that time, however, I did not admit the ""voices"" I was hearing. After I started to lose my sanity more and my symptoms became harder to hide, I decided to see a cognitive behavioral therapist. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Depression. ---------
When most people think of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, they often depict the man who cannot leave his house until he touches his doorknob three times. Some of my most common obsessions include contamination, doubting, and checking. The following are examples of my thoughts: ""I left the door unlocked and someone is going to break into my house and steal my valuables. Did I turn the iron off? I left the iron on and now my house is going to burn down. Did I run over someone while I was driving? I hope this person burns in Hell"" I could list many other disturbing thoughts, but I am often ashamed to admit these thoughts. Initially, I thought these were the demonic voices I was hearing. These violent, twisted thoughts were extremely contradictory to my normal thought pattern. I knew the thoughts could not belong to me. As I began to learn about OCD, I knew it was the disease that plagued my life. My OCD began with scrupulosity and has manifested into many forms of OCD. No one understands OCD's toll on life quality: all I wanted was peace, however, reality became hell. I feel damned. ---------
After all of the things that have changed in my life, nothing was the same. I have lost a part of me in this wilderness: hope. I have stopped hoping for things to get better. I have stopped hoping for my prayers to be answered. I stopped asking God to heal me from this disease. I stopped asking God to take me back. I was forced to grow up in this wilderness. I emerged as a new man and I don't know if I will ever reclaim my previous sense of self. I cannot allow myself to hope again; hope hurts too much. Ahh, you think darkness is your ally? I was born in it, molded by it.

s_1601_96,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I was lucky enough to have attended private school all of my life (except for two months, since I emigrated in April during 2nd grade, and only public school allowed me to get in for the remaining two months). From Grade 5, I attended a catholic smallish school, and on top of that, from Grade 7 to Senior Year, we were all girls. Bullying didn't really happen, and everyone fitted in (no one was left alone, unless they chose to be alone). Girls fight and hate on each other behind each other's back haha. However, my self-esteem dropped immensely some time in Grade 8. I have no idea why. I know it's related to school. I became extremely self-conscious. One of the many reasons I like to blame was that it was in Grade 8 that we started a project, which was a student exchange with kids our age in Mexico. I personally really wanted to just build a cool friendship with someone, and I was unfortunately matched with the 'hottest guy'. We talked, but soon enough I noticed him using me to get to the pretty girls of my year. When they finally came in Grade 9, I went to him to say hi, and he was like ""Hey! You're 'train_subject9951', right?"" and I was really happy he remembered me, but seconds later, he turned his back and started talking to another classmate of mine, who, for some reason, decided not to wear much that day. I was both unhappy and kind of shocked, because, well, I'm not a pretty girl. Felt like all the attention I'll ever get from there on would be from being pretty, which I am not. Girls like girls with whom they can relate to, and most girls of my school were into partying, makeup ... being stereotypical teenage girls. I was not like them. My social skills then dropped to absolute zero, my self-esteem reached an all-time low, and I slowly started secluding myself.

I laugh at how much stupid I might seem to you right now. Hell, I'm only seventeen, and I'm getting depressed over love? There are far worse things to be depressed about. Especially in the Middle East. Honestly, I'm hesitant to label myself as depressed. I know depression is a strong term that's often misused, but I don't know if I'm feeling just sad.

Even though she said she had a great fucking time I just thought she lied and that day I fall for self-pity. Obviously, it didn't stop there and I fucked up everything else I could possibly fuck up by telling her how deeply I felt for her and how lonely and pathetic I am, and how I don't wanna go into a relationship with her because of what happened last time I was in one. I always make the wrong fucking decisions. I always fuck up. I always get into the same fucking situation where I'm hopeless and preparing myself for another night where I'm gonna dream about the same girl I've been dreaming about for the past five years, but somewhere deep down I like that. I like feeling sad. I love listening to Bon Iver just a few minutes before bedtime, staring into the darkness and reminding myself for the thousandth time how fucking pathetic I am. How no one cares. How she doesn't care. How everyone I fucking love doesn't give a damn about me and there's no fucking escape. Everybody's just gonna say that the future's gonna get better, and how love is like that and eventually, I'll forget the girl who fucked up my life and I'm just gonna nod and say, ""Yeah, you're right"" just because I don't wanna make it seem like they've wasted their time on me. I've been writing about what I've been feeling for the past year or so, but I don't think any of you would be interested in reading some teenager's diary about how love made him vulnerable.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember - even as early as Elementary school I've shown symptoms, and there's a huge percentage of depressed people in my family. I was fairly emotional during high school, like a lot of kids, but most of the time I still didn't feel like my head was really in it. I very nearly flunked out, but continuation school and my mom threatening to kick me out at 15 got me to finish. I dabbled in college courses, but never went back and I don't think I earned more than three units in something like three semesters. I had thought it would be a new beginning, something I could dive into, head first, but I hated it. I hated the people, the professors, the coursework. I had always wanted to be a writer, a novelist, but my passion for writing started to die off around that time. It's been a slow, shitty descent since then. I'm now newly 24, I've been in a serious relationship for a little over three years. I'd been in two awful ones before that, both abusive, so this guy is a breath of fresh air. He's really the only person that has made me feel truly, unconditionally loved. And that's why my depression is that much worse. His family has practically zero history of mental illness, and what is there gets swept under the rug. I've actually sat at a table, next to his mother (who doesn't know I'm depressed) while she made loud proclamations that people with mental illnesses shouldn't be allowed to own guns or have children. I've been steadily, secretly in total dislike for her since then. I just don't give a shit anymore. I have so many things to look forward to, I know that - my boyfriend and I are planning on buying a house by the end of the year, we're probably going to get married within a year or so. The few times over the last few years that I've felt real, in-your-face emotions, it's been with him. And yeah, sometimes that's anger, but mostly love. Mostly happy. But I'm so sick of the day in and day out. I've got a chronic spinal condition, it will never go away and I'm in near constant pain. It drives me crazy, knowing that I'll literally never again do anything without first thinking about my condition, about the needs of a stupid glitch in my spine above what I want to do. I self-harmed in December. I won't say much more than that about it, just that I didn't immediately regret it. Still sort of don't. I know it upset my boyfriend, and I think that's the reason I haven't done it again. I hadn't done it since high school, nine years before, and I don't plan on doing it again. It was just like a switch. I felt nothing, nothing, nothing, and then one morning I woke up and I felt everything all at once, a glimmer of happiness among waves of crushing sadness, white-hot anger, so bad I wanted to smash things, break things. That very afternoon, I was back to nothingness, or near-nothingness. You know how it is. Sometimes you feel little things throughout the day that almost make you feel like you're having a good day, until you look back on the week behind you and literally cared so less about it, in hindsight, that you can't remember a damn thing that happened. I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist, I know I should be medicated. But I procrastinate and I feel like, what, going and talking to someone and taking pills is going to magically fix me? And I'll be able to commit to things and feel normal? That's never going to happen, for me, so why bother? I just feel like I'm spending my life waiting to get better when that may never happen, and what then? I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to just go back to sleep, to pass the time. The monotony of daily life is stifling. I do look forward to weekends, to getting things done and deflating and just spending some time with my guy, but as soon as Sunday morning hits and I realize it's basically back to the work week again, I lose whatever grip on normalcy I might have had.

s_2815_1002,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"30 years ago today, my neighbor's son disappeared. 30 years ago, my neighbors across the street, Mr. and Mrs. Stein, endured a terrible loss. Their son, Adam, disappeared on Halloween. It was assumed he was kidnapped, as there was a rash of kidnappings in the area at the time. The kidnapper was never found, though. Neither was Adam. Todays the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. To the Steins, the wounds are still fresh. They refuse to decorate their yard, despite all the houses on the street going out of their way to be as festive as possible. They dont give out candy, despite the rest of the houses on the street trying to one-up each other by giving out better loot than their neighbors. The Steins mourn quietly in their dark house; the television being the only light emanating from their window. Kids are advised by their parents not to knock. Ive always felt bad for them. Ive lived here for 40 years. I remember the frantic search and rescue efforts that swept through our town. Even though I was barely 20 years old and living with my unemployed father while working double shifts to pay our mortgage, I did my part and joined the search. It was the least I could do. Like all futile searches, it ended after a while. Adam was presumed dead. The Steins grew old and the neighborhood changed around us. New families moved in and old ones either died off or moved out. Aside from me and the Steins, Id say the average age of the homeowners here is 35. And they all have lots of kids. A terrible rumor started to spread a couple years ago. I know who started it - an older kid named Chuck Demopoulos. He told his younger brothers and neighborhood friends that Adams ghost haunts the woods behind our street. He said Mr. Stein killed him and chopped him up into little bits. When I learned about the rumor, I was disgusted. The disrespect was so vulgar and uncalled for. I prayed the Steins wouldnt hear about it, but Im sure they must have. It was pervasive. I called Chucks father and told him what I heard, and I suspect Chuck caught a beating for it. Still, Im afraid the damage had already been done. Despite pitying the Steins, I dont express my sympathy by refusing to decorate my house and yard. I love Halloween. Always have. I like to see parents beaming from the street while their kids nervously ring doorbells and collect piles of candy. The spirit of the season keeps me feeling young, despite being well past my prime and having to deal with high blood-pressure. Being an old timer has its perks sometimes. I have Halloween decorations they dont sell anymore. Ghoulish stuff like hangmans nooses - things that are too politically incorrect for stores to sell. I firmly believe Halloween shouldnt be sanitized. It should be scary and unsettling. That said, there needs to be an emotional component, too. Not just blood and guts for the sake of blood and guts. There needs to be poignancy. Something thatll stick with you after you see it. Thats why Adam helps me decorate. After Dad died in 1989, I emptied out his safety deposit box. There was an envelope with note a note and a Polaroid photograph. All the note said was, I caught him snooping around the cellar. I had to teach him a lesson. The photograph was of fresh cement drying on the basement wall. In the middle of the night, I went into the cellar and opened the wall. Adams body was inside. My instinctive reaction was to call the police, but I was terrified Id be arrested. Theyd never believe the note. So I sealed the wall. After a while, I stopped thinking about the dead boy in the bowels of my house. Many years later, after talking with Mrs. Stein about Adam on a Halloween afternoon, I knew what I had to do. I took his remains out of the wall in 2014. He was only a skeleton. I separated the bones, splashed them with fake blood, and incorporated them into my Halloween decorations. At first, I was worried. As the days went by, though, I realized I didnt need to be concerned. The bones blended in with the rest of my decorations. Just more festive material in a neighborhood chock full of it. This morning, when I went out to get the paper, Mr. Stein was doing the same. We met in the street and chatted for a while. We talked about the Cowboys game from last night and he mentioned his wife made a spectacular coffee cake that hed bring me a piece of later. I smiled and told him that would be real nice. Before we parted ways, Mr. Stein said, I never told you how much Shannon and I appreciated all the help you gave us back when we lost Adam. We knew how busy you were. Its been 30 years today, you know. I felt guilt and sadness wash over me. Im sure hes in a better place, I told him. He nodded, and I saw tears in his eyes. He was a good boy. I know wherever he is, hes watching over us. We hugged briefly, then went back to our respective homes. I walked up the driveway, past the ghosts dangling from my trees by their nooses, and headed up my front steps. I looked at the skull hanging above the doorway. It was pointed at the Steins house.

s_1193_416,Find evidence for special case in this post,"""I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head. Why blame myself for all I need help for, in my head?"" Two simple lines from a song, and they've really been the perfect description for my depression. I've been dealing with depression since puberty I suppose. Lately I think I've been doing a pretty good job of getting myself out of funks, and part of it has been a personal philosophy along the lines of the title. You'll see how this is a bit awkward for me to talk about in a second, but if it helps someone else dealing with depression, than I'll be any amount of awkward required. _____
**Personal Story**
For the past few months I've been trying, and it's very hard, to live by the mantra, ""Stop making everything about me."" Relating to the title (I cannot be sure I see the future, in my head) - did some jerk cut me off in traffic? I'm imagining a confrontation with that person, where I'm yelling in their face for being such a big dumb jerk. Or maybe some cute girl helped me out while I was shopping, and I'm imagining a date with this girl, maybe an entire relationship, and then I'm back to reality and single and sad again. I think a lot of my depression comes from ""seeing the future, in my head,"" and they're all futures that don't exist. Living in alternate realities. ""Why blame myself for all I need help for"" - part two. There have been crazy snow/ice storms around where I live for the past month. Two days ago my car got stuck while driving, and it took 3 people to push me out. Not 3 people at once. First one person, that wasn't working, then a second person joined in, still wasn't working, then a third. Humiliating. Absolutely embarrassing and humbling moment. And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm cursing at a God I don't actually believe in, like this whole experience was just him getting me stuck to laugh at my misery. I'm not that important. Cars get stuck in snow. It's something that happens. I needed help, and thankfully, three kind souls helped. Why blame myself for all I need help for? ______
**Coping mechanisms**
I feel I'm already rambling, so maybe if you've already read the above, that's enough to help. But here's what I've been doing whenever I feel those depressed thoughts creeping up (and they're **always** creeping up). 1) ""What's something around me that I can make better?"" - Clean your room, make some nice food, exercise, customize your computer, do some yardwork. But also things like - a few weeks ago, I saw a neighbor across the street furiously shoveling snow. I mean, he looked young and healthy and I was still worried he'd have a heart attack, at the rate he was shoveling. It was one of the hardest things I've done lately, because I am not good with people. But I went into my house, poured an extra large shot of whiskey, and went over to his place and asked if he needed a drink. Ended up chatting for awhile, and yeah he's going through some shit. The point being - I tried to make something around me better. An attempt was made.) As another short anecdote - I had an absolutely terrible day yesterday, and driving home, I was doing nothing **but** getting into imaginary fights with people. It took several repetitions, but I kept thinking, ""I'm in a super bad place right now, what's something I can do to make something better?"" - My answer was, go home, drink whiskey, play video games. Childish, maybe. But as soon as I thought of that, I felt this peace. And I went home, and did exactly that, and it felt amazing. ( Whiskey and video games isn't always the answer :P )
2) this is my emergency backup - ""What's that?"" Basically, there's always something around you to get curious about. I have a coffee mug sitting in front of me. What blend is the coffee? Why is this region a good coffee region, compared to other regions? Now I'm googling things, and learning things, and I'm not sitting in a depressed puddle of ego. ______

I'm very emotionally unstable; I can go from ecstatic to livid like the flip of a switch, and I handle neither particularly well. I have really bad abandonment issues for no apparent reason and it manifests in my testing relationships and generally being an asshole to make sure people don't abandon me. I nearly always feel empty; the only time I don't is during extremely special happy events and when I drink. I make a conscious effort to control my drinking and drink less than once a month, and I'm a lightweight so literally two Smirnoff ice and I'm drunk. I drive and spend rather recklessly and I find myself dissociating and unable to really change my off the wall actions. I also have a history with self harm. I've read that BPD is often hard to diagnose because people with it don't want to be criticized so they won't mention shitty things they do. Because of that, I feel like a fraud, like if I really had it I couldn't be this self critical. I've had some of these symptoms for a long time, but stuff like the dissociating is very recent, like within the last year. The only stable relationships I have are with my wife and my mother. I go through ""friends"" like water and I admittedly am a terrible judge of character so I pick them poorly.","I have irrational, uncontrollable anger that I can't handle well in many situations.",56,0,1

s_282_43,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I need help recognizing and accepting narcissist mother. Sorry for the slightly vague title but I recently came across this thread and I never realized my mom could be one of these but I hope someone who has put up with someone like my mother can help me understand my situation better and hopefully offer some advice as well. It might be a long story. My dad passed away when I was 11. My mom has been ""raising"" me and my sister ever since. She's also a cancer survivor which I think is a pretty noteworthy detail for context. She's a strict Muslim, never went to college and extremely traditional minded. I've been a high achiever all my life. I'm also a closeted gay man who has SEVERAL issues to say the least. Never opened up about any of them in my life but yeah, I'm depressed and suicidal. It sucks that I cannot come out to anyone I know in real life for obvious reasons. As time passed, I found my mental health deteriorating since I couldn't seek help nor even open up about it. I'm supposed to be the pillar of my family now that my father is gone so there's no chance to show vulnerability. It's taking an obvious toll on me and I'm pretty much exhausted. I feel like I'm wasting my life now and I do pretty reckless, harmful things to myself. My mother however is completely oblivious. She continues to guilt trip or emotionally blackmail me. If I under-perform in a test, she brings up the fact how she's a single mother who raised us. If I talk back or ask her to give me space because I'm an ADULT who can make his own decisions, she reminds me how she has no one left since my dad is gone. If I don't talk to her she starts pretending like her health is *worsening*. Being dramatic, faking being dizzy, not eating in front of me but acting normal when I'm not around and all that. She is AWARE that she's quite literally the only person I have left on this Earth. If she's ""gone"", no one's going to take care of me and my sister and I'm not independent enough to do that either. She takes full advantage of the fact. She'll constantly victimize herself in situations that solely affect me. She guilt tripped me into picking a career field I have LOST interest in and clearly can't excel it, simply because it was her and my late father's dream. These are BIG decisions that she's so precariously making about my life, because to her, Im a puppet of her desires. I recently caught her talking about me behind my back. She was complaining about how I'm underperforming in school to my aunt and whatever. Keep in mind that ALL MY LIFE until now, I've been an A+ student. She wasn't worried about me under-performing, she was upset that I'm not ""making her proud in the family"" like I used to before. And who cares about what I'M going through? She just wants the praise. She'll constantly remind me to ""go study"" and it BOTHERS me so much because is that all there is to life? First she makes me choose a degree I NEVER wanted to do, then she borderline forces me to study at my big age and then she acts upset when I don't listen to her? I'm an ADULT but she ONLY sees me as a vessel who's going to fulfill all her dreams and give her a life of luxury. I CAN'T HAVE MY LIFE. And the worst part is, it will ONLY get worse from here. She expects me to get married and what not. I seriously feel like I'm nothing but a toy doll. I'm not allowed to have ANYTHING of my own, just things that make HER happy. She wants grandkids, I have to give her biological grandkids. She wants a doctor for a son? I have to become the doctor. She wants a big house, nice car and lots of servant buzzing around her, I have to earn it all and give it to her. And what do I get? Constant blackmailing, torture and absolutely no sense of individuality. I don't know who I am anymore, just that I am what she wants me to be. When someone asks me what I like, I say biology, not because I like it, but because she wants me to like it. This is another stupid detail but just to add on to how fucking frustrated I am by her. I am colorblind. During my chemistry practical tests, it's hard for me to distinguish color changes and everything. I can ask for assistance but I made the dumb mistake of mentioning it to my mother. She told me I'm not colorblind, told me to NEVER tell my teachers because that's a sign of weakness and they could use that as an excuse to fail me in my practical tests and to never seek for help. It's so bad that I'm ashamed of even mentioning to anyone that I'm colorblind. Because that makes me the not perfect kid. I want to run away but I'm so emotionally attached to her, even though shes CLEARLY so toxic. I don't want to lose her. When she had cancer, it was the worst time of my life because I lost my dad and I was scared of losing her too. I was only 11 and my sister was 9. I still have that fear and I love my sister, I don't want to leave her behind but I can't live with this woman any longer. I don't wish death upon her by any means but I just desperately need a way out and it's driving me crazy that there's no way out. Is she really a narcissist or is there some other issue with her?","I feel like I'm wasting my life now and I do pretty reckless, harmful things to myself.",1169,6,1

I currently am going through some tough times right now as well. While they aren't over, maybe it'll make you feel better to know you aren't alone. After being at the top of my class, in the honors program, and class president, I got discriminated by a teacher verbally and emotionally over and over again. Just brought my self confidence to an all time low. I developed panic disorder, lost my position on council, got kicked out of the program as senior in college, and now I have to start all over in another major when I thought I was going to graduate this year at the top of my grade. Though I can't get over it, learned to COPE. I talked to friends, I started to take life day by day and stopped planning into the future unless i really needed to. I tell myself I'm beautiful everyday, I tell myself I'm not worthless - even thought sometimes I don't believe it, but you know - sometimes I do.

s_3047_140,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"My life is still too complicated I've changed my life completely in the past 9 years; went from a corporate retail job to being a freelance writer, moved from a 3/2/1 house to eventually this 520 sf apartment. I went from 1/4 acre lot to about 250 sf of garden space. I no longer own a car, so walk, bus and ride a bike (hadn't been on one in 20 years before this) everywhere. I spend less then $200 a month for food most months. I have very, very few clothes (down from two closets full previously), one good pair of jeans, and one good pair of walking shoes. Yesterday, I got tired of washing eating utensils, so I put away all but 2 of everything except I kept out 9 spoons, because that's mostly what I eat with. I don't really need 9 spoons, but I don't want to have to keep washing them all day, so 9 it is. I share a small community garden plot close by, and I've gotten to where I hate going there, because it's just one more chore I have to do. I had huge plans for planting my courtyard but instead, I've decided to lay out an area for a few favorite plants, then fill the rest in with mulch because it's just something I have no interest in anymore. I sometimes pick up things I think I'll eventually need or can use from beside the apartment dumpsters, but lately, I've been taking dumpster finds back out to the dumpster, because I want space more than I want stuff. I think a lot about getting rid of it all and going to live in a van, traveling around the country, because I've never really seen the U.S. due to no money to travel. I don't know how long I could do that, but every time I have to do a deep clean of the apartment because it's gotten a little out of hand, I think how nice it must be only to have a tiny little van full of the essentials of life. Just now, while I was watering my indoor plants, I thought ""I should just give all of these away. What good are they to me, really?"" Plants and gardening used to be my life, and now it just seems like work. It's all just so much to take care of! My neighbor was shocked I don't have a washer and dryer, and I told her it's just one more thing to break and have to get fixed. She didn't understand how I can stand going to the laundry room to do my laundry, but I explained to her that I have so few clothes and linens now that I can do it all in two loads once a week. I wish I could do it in one. If I lived in a van, I could do it in one. I look at everything in here every day and think ""I don't need this or that or that or ..."" you get the idea. I have 5 frying pans. Who the hell needs 5 frying pans? I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of. If I didn't have all these things, I wouldn't need all this space. Am I going insane, or does anyone else feel this way?","I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of.",2584,1,1

I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall.

Being anemic, I would lose consciousness all the time, miss school, vomit ... it was terrible. For the past year though, it has been better. No loss of consciousness (though I do feel dizzy from time to time), less vomiting (though now everything is coming out — at the same speed I should say — at the other end), and no missing scheduled activities. However one thing has not changed: I feel gross. I am not even affected by how society views this ""normal and healthy"" part of a female's life. Whatever people say, periods are gross. It smells, it's uncomfortable, it's messy, and there's no way to control it. I'm pretty sure if once a month, the anus decided to evacuate on its own for six days straight and all you could do is sit in a diaper at all time, it would feel the same way. One week a month, I stop working. I lose my appetite, I lose my motivation and my energy. I lose my focus and my memory as well. All my movements feel automated. I hate leaving my room when it happens. All I do is go back-and-forth between there and the bathroom. Being in College and all, I obviously have to leave my house almost every day, but I spend most of my time worrying about leakage and smell. No amount of good hygienes will change the fact that as I'm sitting down in the middle of 30+ people, blood is coming out of my vagina, and I'm sitting in it. I could shower thrice a day, change my pad every hour or empty a bottle of perfume on my nether region, nothing would change. I am amazed at how very few females seem affected by their period. I applaud those women. Unfortunately I am not at their level. I cannot stop thinking about what is happening between my legs because I can feel it. I don't like this feeling of uncleanness, as if I haven't wiped in a year. I cannot deal with this smell I can't seem to detach myself from, even though now I've learned it's all in my head. I can't deal with the fact that it leads to my inactivity, as if my body is slowly shutting down on me. It's been nearly a decade and I still haven't gotten my shit together. I've failed mother nature.","I lose my appetite, I lose my motivation and my energy.",1202,2,1

I'll mumble a quick ""sorry"" and we'll both be back asleep again in seconds. I've also hit him in my sleep a few times, usually pretty hard, I always feel really bad about it, especially seeing as I'm normally half awake as I do it, and realise just as I thump him that whatever I was fighting in my dream is actually just my sleeping SO. The first time I did it was only a week or so into our relationship, felt so so guilty about. I'd done the shouting thing before with a previous partner, but the hitting is a recent thing (I must sound like such a terrible person now, omg, he's pretty chill about it thankfully and teases me about it). I'm honestly not an angry person or anything, IRL I'm really normally passive and quiet and would never hit anybody and rarely shout, nor do I tend to have particularly violent dreams.

s_106_89,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"Okay, so this is how I feel. I'm a 19 year old guy currently on my gap year (year break before college/university that we do in England). I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem. I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault. I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that? Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel ""Sad"" because im a young teenager with hormones in me. But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread.

Maybe if some miracle happens and my life gets better again but thats not done with endless therapist conversations. Do not gie me medical advice I have been going to doctors and trying healthy lifestyles for years and i'm still always tired without knowing the cause. Bad physical and mental health have made it impossible for me to live my life. I cannot enjoy life and I also cannot make progress towards my future. That means im worthless. I lost all hope for my future. Is it even possible to enjoy life and chase my future dreams in this situation? I dont think so. Im not capable of anything anymore. And no my depression won't go away until something good comes into my life. I dont know what to do anymore. The only way out of this miserable situation seems to be suicide. I won't do it. But I have no hope. What can I do???",I lost all hope for my future.,2048,0,1
s_701_803,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I feel hopeless... A prisoner of my mind. I don't really know where to start, but I'll try anyway. I was diagnosed with Psychosis NOS about a year and a few months ago, then it progressed into a diagnosis of basically schizophrenia, to put it bluntly. With schizophrenia we have 2 blocks of symptoms, negative and positive. Negative is basically, lack of emotion, extreme lack of motivation, poor hygiene, disorganization (which Is pretty strong for me, stronger than the other negative symptoms) etc. Positive symptoms are just basically psychosis. Anyway, because of this, I had do drop out of school, as directed by my doctors. I lost most of my friends, except one and he has always been my best friend, but he's just came back into the picture (which is great btw, when you've been in extreme isolation for a year that shit will touch your heart more than anything). Being in extreme isolation and barely getting sunlight other than the sun rays coming through my window, is extremely depressing especially when you're not in an episode and have to reflect on how this has affecting your life...
I've just started getting tutoring back in my school, once a week... I don't see the point in going back to school any more, I'm already behind everyone, people think I'm stupid because I don't go to school (even though I've learned a lot of stuff on my own in the past year). Schizophrenia (with depression, but depression hasn't been diagnosed, it's probably depression because of the schizophrenia). I feel absolutely hopeless, it's like I can't get something inside my head out... I just want to be normal again, but there's always something inside my mind stopping me. I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now. I'll answer any question to clarify anything... Thank you.","I used to think I would have a good career, have a good life etc... That's all completely ruined now.",1675,0,1
s_3040_683,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I failed two classes this semester. I've been too sad to go to class, so the ones that take attendance failed me. They were both major classes. I drink too much. I know I do, and I know it's a problem. But drunk is pretty much the only time I don't feel miserable. I graduated high school 6th in my class. My gpa was 3.86. I was depressed, but it came so easily to me. Now, after my third year of college, I'll be lucky to have a 2.3. I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure. I'm afraid to see my family. My sister is about to get her Ph.D. from one of the best schools in the country. My dad has one in physics, and recently got sober. I can't even work up the energy to cry. I'm broke, so I can't even buy booze to make myself feel better. Even my cats don't make me feel any better about myself. I've gained a bunch of weight, I haven't showered in a week, and I never see any friends. I still have two more finals and I don't care, but I know I need to step it up if I want to not fail all of my classes. It's getting time where I have to start worrying about getting jobs. I'm gonna have to take a victory lap, which my parents are fine with, but I may even need two. I'm going part time next semester, for sure, but I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. I've always dreamed of working in the government, but I'm so far from the cream of the crop that I'm that rejected corn that gives livestock mad cow. I had to drop my French major, which means my fallback of becoming a French teacher isn't even a possibility anymore. I've wanted to do the Peace Corps for forever, but I doubt I can bring my cats with me to Africa, and I doubt even more that I can go two years without them. On top of that, they wouldn't accept me with my grades. Tl;dr: I failed my first two classes ever this semester, I feel like a failure, and I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life. All I wanna do is cry, and I can't even do that.","I just haven't cared all semester, and now I feel like a complete failure.",435,6,1

s_2816_0,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"I'm so tired of being a failure I'm 9 months into my PhD, and while I love(d?) my topic, my advisor is kind, my peers are lovely, the work is (should be?) engaging... I just lack all motivation completely. For the past year I've been on a slow decline of motivation and caring. I stopped engaging in society activities at my undergrad uni, even though I was leader of a society there -- I barely managed enough to keep things ticking over. Through desperation and sheer will I still finished my last year with good grades, enough to be accepted into an amazing grad school, but it was a significant dip on previous years. But then over the course of my PhD it's just been getting worse. It started with a few days of missed work, here and there. I don't think my living situation at the time helped -- just renting a room in a house, with a live-in landlady who was actually horrible (even though she seemed nice enough at first). So I'd just shut myself away in my room all day, slink out to make food (lol, reheat in microwave) when no one was home. Honestly, I think it accelerated the downward spiral a lot, as it brought back a lot of bad memories of my abusive upbringing -- of not feeling like I belonged in my own home, being judged for every action, just hiding in a quiet corner of refuge (yet still worrying someone would barge in any minute). I'm in my own place now, but things are still bad. I think covid isn't helping -- since March I've done maybe a few weeks of worthwhile work, but there have been weeks on end that I have done \*nothing\*. I've told my advisors and they're nice about it and all but I have a first year progress update coming up in 2 weeks that I've barely started and I go entire days just staring at a computer doing fucking nothing. I go days without brushing my teeth, without showering. Sometimes all I'll eat in a day is bowls of cereal. I walk a lot and that used to clear my head but now I'll just walk outside for hours with no sense of direction or track of time. I feel like I'm not in control of my life at all anymore and I just can't deal with the constant guilt about the opportunities I'm wasting. I spoke to my tutor recently and he put me in touch with the uni mental health advisor. We spoke on the phone for about an hour, and she was helpful, and listened to my problems. But then her next phone call was basically just ""register for uni counselling and / or talk to your GP about going on antidepressants"" without any guidance on doing either of those things. I'm an international student and haven't registered with a GP in this country yet, because I need my medical records to do so -- medical records which I've tried to obtain before but can't work out at all because my country's health records are all decentralised, so I'd need to know who my childhood GP(s) was / were, but I aged out of foster care and don't speak to my bio parents anymore. I'm sure there must be someone who would know how to get them for me, or how to register with the GP without them, but it just feels like an insurmountable task. I'm such a failure that I can't even register for counseling properly and that just crushes me. I don't even know if what I'm experiencing right now is just some weird fucked up complex grief because my estranged brother died 18 months ago and my childhood best friend died back in February, or if this is just who I am now and my brain is actually broken. I don't know. I used to be such a high achiever, such a hard worker, used to shit out 12 hours of work straight no problem. I just want to go back to that. I want things to be how they used to be. I know that's a lot of stream of consciousness, but given the whole too-fucking-stupid-to-register-for-counseling thing I just had to vent somewhere.",I'm such a failure that I can't even register for counseling properly and that just crushes me.,3073,6,1

s_1483_41,Find evidence for suicidal thoughts in this post,"First, sorry that it took a week for me to respond. I don't necessarily think it's a good thing. And I think that a person should seek help before resorting to suicide. But ultimately I think suicide is a personal choice and it's better to be given a solution that would cause the least potential for pain. I can't imagine attempting to kill myself, failing, and being scarred or maimed by my attempt. I understand the argument that suicide isn't only about you and it effects your loved ones as well. But that's kind of an unfair argument. Take myself for example. Every day, I wake up absolutely depressed. It takes a genuine concentrated effort to even get out of my bed to go to the bathroom. I have a therapist, I go to therapy once a week. I'm medicated. All that does nothing to change the fact that I pray every night for death. The only reason I don't kill myself is for my kids. But it's such a difficult argument. I am only remotely close to happy every other weekend when they come over. So 1/7 of my life is tolerable. The rest of the time is spent literally begging for death. So, on the argument of ""don't kill yourself because it will make others sad"", why should I continue to suffer day in and day out, just so others don't have to be sad for a day or 2. The only reason their happiness matters more than mine is because they're my kids and it's my duty to keep them from harm as best as I can. Take my children out of the equation and is literally be living only to keep my mother from being sad for a week or 2.

I also really want to be one of those people who loves to-do lists and can write a manageable to-do list and actually stick to it. I basically just build up the task so much - i.e. I need to clean my apartment. I know I need to do it, but I think, whatever, it's clean enough, and I put it off. Then it gets worse, and I start feeling guilty, but I tell myself it's fine. It keeps getting worse, and I stubbornly refuse to clean it at this point. I tell myself, ""I'm going to do this when I feel like it,"" and I never do. Then it's so awful the guilt basically consumes me and it takes me practically 5 hours to clean my place and afterwards I despise cleaning so much that I let it get to that state continuously.
