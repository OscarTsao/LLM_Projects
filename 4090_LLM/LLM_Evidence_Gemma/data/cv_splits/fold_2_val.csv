How long should I give it to work before calling my pcp? 33F, White, 155lbs, 54. Medications: Esomeprazole 40mg, Zoloft 50 mg. I take a probiotic supplement for IBS-C. Medical conditions: GERD, IBS-C. Relevant history: I have a tube already in my left ear . Its been in place for about 18 months, and was checked a few months back and still place and looking good. Also, my two kids have had some general crud this week: low-grade fevers, sneezing, and snotty noses. They werent seen at the doctor, but seem to be recovered now. I started feeling poorly Friday, just a headache and a little mucus in my nose. Saturday (yesterday,) I woke up with a swollen lymph node in front of my left ear (I think its called preauricular) that was ridiculously painful and my ear started to hurt slightly throughout the day. I called Doctor on Demand who prescribed me prednisone for the lymph node and told me to start Flonase. I slept 10 hours last night, which is a lot for me, and then took a 2 hour nap today. I dont have a fever, but feel slightly chilled and clammy like I am feverish. My ear feels slightly full, and the left side of my face is tender, in addition to the headache. I got really light headed randomly this afternoon as well. I have taken the 20mg prednisone last night and today, and have three more days of it to take. I feel really terrible, and fatigued. How long should I wait before being seen in person?

s_2815_1660,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"Comfort Food My wife lost her battle with bone cancer a year ago. I have no one. Ive worked from home for the last six months. My employer has been sympathetic and accommodating after everything that happened. Too many workplaces neglect and end up getting rid of disabled employees. I guess I should feel valued. Breakfast was mac and cheese left over from the night before. I hadnt made enough for my breakfast to be even remotely satisfying. Stock prices and quantitative analytics spilled from my computer monitors as I tried to concentrate on work. My eyes kept drifting over to the picture of me and Brynn on our wedding day. I have no attention span when Im hungry. I groaned as I lifted myself into a standing position. My knees were shot. I made my way over to the kitchen pantry and got a bag of chips and a bottle of soda. Coughing as I trundled across the office over to my desk, Id already opened the chips and was pushing them into my mouth. As I walked by and saw my reflection in the glossy murk of my hibernating television, I could swear I saw Brynn standing by my side. When I blinked, she was gone. Just like a year ago. By lunchtime I was just finishing the chips and the bottle of soda. I was ravenous. My concentration had improved somewhat as I ate, and I made a few good trades that got my company some cash and me a nice commission or two. But it was noon. The market volume was drying up as everyone went to lunch. Id start working again around two and go hard until closing bell. Until then, I had to eat something. The pizza delivery guy always brings me extra stuff because Im a generous tipper. At this point in my career, I earn more money than I know what to do with, so why not spread it around? I ordered two large Sicilian pizzas, some mozzarella sticks, garlic knots, and chicken alfredo. The delivery guy brought me a pint of ice cream and a cannoli. He got a $100 tip. I think my interaction with him is some of the only person-to-person contact I have nowadays. I sat in front of the TV as I ate. I didnt bother to turn it on. When I looked up after finishing my first pizza, Brynns reflection was watching me. Her body was distorted by the curved surface of the television. She was shorter. Heavier looking. Compressed. She moved her arms as if to embrace me. I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to regain my composure. I had to be hallucinating. The lids of my eyes lifted to the sight of her face inches from mine. My scream reverberated throughout my cavernous office space. Before Id finished my yell, shed wrapped her arms around me and nestled her head against my shoulder. Everything went white. All I can remember from that moment was blissful warmth and closeness. I can only describe it as reexperiencing the minute I knew I was in love with her, along with all the associated tactile sensations of the most intimate embrace Id ever felt. The experience couldnt have lasted more than two seconds. When it was over, it was as if every organ had been ripped from my body and Id been left to exsanguinate on the floor. A feeling of overwhelming emptiness swept over me like an atomic inferno. My mourning period following Brynns death was nothing compared to this. I was a bottomless pit of despair and loneliness. The expanse of my lunch was still spread in front of me. Mindlessly, I began eating. Every swallow felt like an eyedropper of water attempting to refill an evaporated oceanscape. But it was progress. I ate until nothing was left. My stomach ached, protesting the amount of food it had been forced to accommodate in such a short period of time. But the hunger remained. The emptiness remained. And it taunted me. I tried to get on with my day. Work was out of the question. There wasnt much food in my house, so Id started drinking soda. I definitely had enough of that. One of my closets had countless three-liter bottles of the generic brand I preferred over the popular ones. Id gone through two of them before I started feeling lightheaded. I couldnt begin to imagine what this was doing to my already-unhealthy blood sugar. That was the least of my concerns. Around 8pm I walked out of my house for the first time in almost a month. Everything had been delivered to me over that period of time. Hoping there was still gas in my X5, I clambered up into the drivers seat. I was shocked at how much bigger Id gotten since I last drove and felt my only moment of relief all day when I discovered the seat could go back another few inches. The car started with no effort and I began driving to the store. I was in no condition to drive. My vision kept blurring and despite the tremendous pain of emptiness I felt, I desperately wanted to go to sleep. I managed to keep my composure, however, and made it to my destination. Even with the handicap tags on my truck, the short walk from it to the store felt like torture. I was wheezing by the time Id taken my cart and started pushing it around the front of the store. There was no way Id use one of the motorized scooters they provide. I dont have much pride left, but I still have enough to keep walking until I simply cant anymore. I bought whatever was closest to the doors and the cash registers. I didnt care what. I had a bagboy help me load up my car with the three carriages-worth of food Id purchased. The gratitude I felt for him and his colleague as they pushed and emptied the carts was immeasurable and I emptied my wallet of cash to thank them. I went home. My entire trip was spent eating. When I got back I turned off the car and sat in the dark, illuminated only by the dim light of my garage. I frantically worked to tear away wrapping and packaging. Sleeves of crackers disappeared down my throat. Partially-frozen TV dinners of meatloaf and mashed potatoes followed. I sobbed as I pushed it all into my mouth, hacking and coughing crumbs onto my steering wheel and dashboard. Only when my stomach pain was nearly unbearable did my feeling of emptiness dip to a level where I had the strength to get out of the garage. It took nearly an hour to empty my car of the colossal amount of food Id purchased. I crashed onto my couch, gasping for air as stars twirled before my eyes. A few minutes later, after Id regained some semblance of wherewithal, I felt an acute pain in my right shoulder. When I reached around with my left hand to investigate, I yelped as I sliced into my index finger. Some asshole had left a juice glass on the arm of the couch and it had fallen off onto the cushion. That same asshole recently fell onto that couch without looking and shattered the glass with his shoulder. I went into the bathroom. A familiar, morbidly-obese man greeted me in my full-length mirror. I turned to look at the damage to my shoulder. Chunks of glass were embedded in my shirt and skin underneath. Despite my disgust with myself and the pain in my shoulder and stomach and finger, I felt slightly better and less empty. Sighing, I pulled off my shirt and felt shards of glass detach from my shoulder and plink onto the ground. The feeling of emptiness reemerged like the head of a hydra. I began to cry. I stared into the mirror at my shirtless self, watching the blood trickle from my shoulder in thin rivulets which were stopped by the absorbent waistband of my sweatpants. I wrapped my arms around my body in desperation. The cheap facsimile of an embrace only served to make me sob harder. I released the hold and started plucking the remaining glass from my shoulder. Each removed shard made the feeling of empty loneliness intensify. The feeling became overwhelming when I pulled out the last piece. I stared at the shard through my tears with curiosity. Then, without a hint of critical thought, I pushed the shard back into my shoulder. A tiny fraction of my emptiness evaporated. A fraction comparable to an entire stomach-full of food. Time seemed to freeze as I methodically broke the larger shards of glass Id removed from my shoulder into hairpin-sized needles. I carefully plunged them into my skin. By the time Id finished with the glass, there was a semicircle of crystalline splinters decorating my upper arm. Warmth radiated out from the shards and suffused through the surrounding skin. The pain was miniscule compared to the emptiness the glass had helped eliminate. With more energy than Id been able to muster since my experience with my wifes apparition this afternoon, I hurried to my office to find my stapler. I assumed I was losing my mind. A healthy person doesnt see his dead wife. A healthy person doesnt ameliorate emptiness through food and glass. But what I felt was real to me. It was as real as the floor on which I stood and as real as the air filling my lungs as I gasped with the tiny pinpricks of relief I felt as each staple entered my arm. I emptied the stapler into myself, refilled it four times, and was left looking for something new to use. I went to the garage and over to Brynns work area. She would frame pictures and paintings for her friends and family and even set up an Etsy shop before her diagnosis. Everything was right where shed left it. An hour went by as I pushed tiny, sharp framing nails into my other arm. These hurt much more than the glass or the staples. I arranged them in a tight, sleeve-like grid. Pain radiated throughout the limb, but I persisted. A few times, when I blinked, I saw Brynn. Right now, its the morning after the events Ive described. I havent slept. My night was spent finding ways to fill that void inside me. Up to this point, Ive been successful. Every part of me hurts, though. Everything, from the top of my head to the bottoms of my feet, is covered; punctured and impaled in some way. Most of it is broken glass from the various glasses and china sets in the kitchen. Some of it is from my wifes old sewing box. Each of my fingertips have long pins originating right underneath the nail and terminating somewhere up toward the knuckles in my hands. Its hard to type with straight fingers. Im standing at my computer desk because my back and buttocks are caked with broken glass and the pain is too intense when I sit down. Even though the bottoms of my feet are equally encrusted, I have less sensation in them because of my underlying medical conditions. When I walk, I can feel the thicker and longer chunks of glass carving at the bone. The part I find most difficult to deal with are the series of thumbtacks in my soft palate. They are constantly causing me agonizing discomfort and they itch just as much as they hurt. I cant help but to trace my tongue around them which just draws my attention to their presence even more. The constant, caustic undulations of searing pain are only tempered by brief, infinitesimally-soft brushes of warmth. I know its my wife trying to touch me again. But the feeling of emptiness within me is still there, albeit far less intense than yesterday. Ignoring it just makes it worse. I have to keep going, but I dont have any space left. I know what Im going to do next, and probably finally, and thats okay. In a few minutes, Ill be slashing open my belly and thighs and arms and stuffing them with the entire pantrys-worth of our splintered wedding china. I cant live with this feeling of emptiness. If doing this is what it takes to give me some relief and peace of mind and body, its what needs to happen. I have the knife honed and ready. As I write this, I know with 100% certainty Im not in my right mind. Ive long since stopped caring. And with that, Im going to go now. Whether or not this plan works, at the end of it all, I might have the opportunity to be with Brynn again. That's worth more than anything in this life.",I began to cry.,7118,0,1

s_2292_195,Find evidence for special case in this post,"Dad: I'm sorry I don't have a job. I'm sorry I can't always clean the house in the timeliest of manners. For the most part, I'm too busy trying not to have a complete mental breakdown. As far as my psychological/emotional needs, I have almost nothing right now, and you know this. My doctor diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety over two years ago, and she and I have made close to no progress since then at fighting it. I know your family comes from the South originally, so you probably grew up being told that depression and other psychological illnesses aren't ""real,"" and that people who claim to have them are making excuses for being weak. That's not the case. Doctors get paid to know things like this-- please listen to what they say. I know I have luxuries-- I live alone in a house that you own, and you don't charge me rent. You pay my bills. You even treat me to things I don't need. Thanks to you, I have an Xbox 360, an Xbox One, and more games than I know what to do with. But you also know that there's a lot I don't have. My only emotional caregiver, your first wife and my biological mother, passed away when I was 13. I never got over it, and I don't know if you have or haven't, but you know how close I was to her, so you can imagine the emotional plunge that I took when I lost her 13 years ago. Eventually, around five years ago, I became close to my older cousin, and he and I pretty much became best friends. He was such a positive person that it was almost impossible to be depressed around him. We were as close as brothers. He died in a car accident two years ago. He was your brother's son, and you're very close to all of your siblings, so I know you understand how I feel about losing him. It's almost identical to what I went through when mom passed away. Despite having the two most positive emotional influences in my life ripped away from me, I tried to stay positive. I tried to do the right thing. My grades slipped when I was a teenager, so I never graduated high school, but I still applied for and attended the local community college. The work was far more difficult, if not tedious, than I had anticipated, and I felt overwhelmed. I told you this, and you understood and suggested that I withdraw until I was ready to maybe try again. I thank you for that. After that, one of my friends (and his girlfriend) moved in with me in the house I'm in now. They were both psychology majors, so they actually understood my problems, and they were fun to be around. They helped mitigate my emotional problems. Then, a misunderstanding (it had nothing to do with the girl-- don't worry) caused a falling out a little over a year ago. He and I haven't spoken since. As you can see, every source of emotional comfort that I've had is being taken away from me. I don't believe in God, and I know you don't like that, but at the same time, I can't help but feel as if I'm being picked on. Right now, as I've said, with the three aforementioned people being taken away from me in one way or another, I have no emotional support from anyone. My health insurance plan ran out recently, and the process to apply for a new plan is taking far longer than either of us expected (however, when I did have insurance, you made sure that I had all my prescription medications and was able to see my doctor regularly, and I owe you a lot for that). In the present day, as of right now, I'm bordering on a massive panic attack everyday. I feel like crying 24 hours a day, even when doing things that I enjoy (which is sometimes, counterintuitively, a major chore). I don't have any friends. I never leave the house. I have no money. I have nothing to purge the emotional turmoil I endure on a daily basis. I sleep at night like most people do, and I sleep periodically during the day because it's the only way I know to escape the inevitable depression and anxiety I go through at all times. I can only handle it for so many hours at a time. I know I have you. And I appreciate everything you do for me. You do everything that you can. But you and I both know that you're not a nurturer. I don't hold that against you, either, just to be clear. That was what mom did for me, while you and I had fun doing typical father-son things, and we still do. We had a blast watching the Super Bowl three weeks ago and casually talking trash to one another, along with my uncles and cousins. I value those times with you-- please don't think otherwise. The problem is that I've tried to explain my emotional issues to you, and you don't seem to understand. You don't get how I can have all day, everyday, to myself and not get anything constructive done around the house on a consistent basis. I've tried to explain this to you in the best way I can think to put it: Video games are probably my favorite hobby, and, as I mentioned in passing earlier, it's sometimes a chore to turn on one of my consoles and play a game and have fun. __ It's difficult for me to do things that I *enjoy*.__ Imagine how hard it is for me to do things that I *hate* doing, like cleaning, or looking for a job, or working, or doing schoolwork. I love you. You do far more than you have to for me, even if you do have a short temper at times and seem to be stubborn about my emotional problems. I've always considered this to be something that can't be said until you're in a situation that calls for it, but I know with almost no doubt that I would die for you. I would step in front of a bullet to keep you from being shot. I owe you my life. It's that simple. I just want you to try a little harder to understand what's wrong with me and why. I know that you can't be for me what my mother was-- no one can do everything. But I do need help. Professional help. And once I get that help, hopefully, I'll be ""cured"" of my depression and anxiety. Once that happens, I'll likely be a far more productive person, and I'll be able to function much better than I do now. I'll clean the house regularly. I'll go to school. I'll shower everyday. I'll get a job. I'll pay rent and pay my own bills. I just need you to be patient until I become healthy enough to get to that point. I can't explain how much that would mean to me. I hope you understand my plight. Or perhaps I'm being unfair; I feel as if I should keep an open mind since I'm asking you to do the same. __Maybe we should let /r/depression be the judge of whether or not I receive too much and give too little. Let them opine on the possibility that maybe I'm asking too much of you. Feel free to post your thoughts, Redditors. I won't take offense to anything. I already feel nearly worthless.__ If I am, I sincerely apologize, and I'll do whatever I can to fix it. Once again, I love you, and I know you love me as well. But not only do I love you, I *need* you. I need your support to pull myself from this abyss of depression and into the life of a functional adult. Thanks for everything, dad. I won't ever be able to repay you, but I know I'll try once I get healthy.","My doctor diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety over two years ago, and she and I have made close to no progress since then at fighting it.",281,9,1

And in 10-20 years after those happen, I could finally off myself. A lonely middle aged man commits suicide. I bet thats gonna be the heading out of the news piece. Or maybe there wouldnt be any news piece at all. The world has 7 billion already and would definitely be 9 in 20 years. One guy dead isnt gonna be news in the future. The world would go on. Maybe Id find the meaning of life after my death. You know, were teeny tiny dust particles in this gigantic universe. In the longer run , in a few billion years , nothing would matter. Earth might not even exist. But I have a family: my parents and sister, so I have to take care of them. Otherwise Id have already killed myself because I dont have much appetite for things in this world. The things that used to excite me arent the same for me anymore. Sometimes I feel like killing myself to see whats on the other side.",Otherwise Id have already killed myself because I dont have much appetite for things in this world.,2187,8,1

This feeling started at work about 2 months ago and once in awhile I would find myself really in the dumps outside of work, but not too often. The longer time went on I would feel worse and worse outside of work. The last 3 weeks or so it's become so prominent in my life the only time I escape it is when I'm with friends. Even then I get an occasional feeling of hate for myself. I've been getting about 3 headaches a day the past week and I haven't been sleeping well. I've had a shitty appetite and I'm starting to hate everything about myself. It was suggested to me by my HR that I take some time off to try to clear my head. Tomorrow is my first day back in two weeks. Things haven't gotten better and I'm always alone at work. I'm scared to go back. I don't want to. We have a point system there and if you get to 10 you're fired. Work was a trigger for me so I've collected either 8, 9 or 10 in the last 2 months or so. I forgot how many I had so I could be getting fired when I come in tomorrow. I need money and I've applied to new jobs already just in case, but I know if I get fired it will be the most bittersweet thing in my life right now. I would've gotten rid of a large stressor in my life, but I would not have enough money. I'm 20, live with two roommates and go to school. My family is poor and I know they would struggle to support me if I didn't have a job. I have my own bills to pay and I'm really going to be screwed for a bit. All of my friends with the exception of 4 are away for school now and ude to school I won't have much time to see them. I'm scared things are going to get worse and my feelings will only escalate into something that could be troubling. I was recently rejected by this girl that I've still been friends with and tonight a friend went to a fair with her. When I asked that friend what he was doing earlier in the day (I wanted to hang out) he said he just wanted to stay at home tonight. I found out because the girl I like told me that they were going to the fair. That made me feel really shitty. My Mom's birthday was a couple of days ago and I forgot to at least call her. I felt like I was worthless for forgetting. It was 6pm and she texted me and she had to tell me it was her birthday. I really didn't want to live anymore after that text. I'm scared I'm becoming a huge failure and disappointment to myself. I want something bad to happen to me so I die. I know I wouldn't be able to take my own life from myself, but I don't think I would hesitate to try to save myself from anything bad happening to me. I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to feel shitty and scared all the time. I'm becoming extremely irritable, I find myself being quick to judge and then hate other people. I'm becoming an extremely bitter and pessimistic person. I'm seeing a therapist once a week now. I need that to help me. I need a lot right now.

( So this is the story of how I got over my depression, and your guy's help in all of this, if you decide to read this wall of text then thanks! It was the tenth of December, and I just turned 16 on the third. I didn't bother to get my license because I had nobody. I had a lack of friends, lack of motivation, and I just wanted to die. On the ninth I cut myself two times in the morning before school, and wore my favorite sweater to cover it up. When I got home I tried again. It felt like I had nothing more to do, and that was it. I was a hermit, and the only place I felt safe or happy was my room in the basement. I even bought a couch, and a bunch of instruments to occupy my time. This was all on an old account, but I remember asking you guys about how to talk to people or get friends. I remember one of you said I should try talking to girls. This was weird because usually girls made fun of me and pushed me away. You guys said it would really help, and you were right! There was one person who really got me out of this, and of course you guys too :D.
I had been talking to and texting this girl from my science class for awhile beforehand, at least two months. She was really the only person who showed me genuine kindness at the time, and it felt amazing. I spiked up my hair like I like to do, put on my second favorite sweater, and got really excited. I asked her to go for a walk at her favorite place, the water tower hill. Eventually it became my favorite place to be too! She wasn't allowed to have guys over at the time so we met at the hill whenever we could. * Sorry for rambling on back to the story...*
So I remember rolling up my sleeves because it was either really hot outside, or I was nervous and really sweaty. Of course stupid me, I forgot about my cuts. When we met at the bottom of the hill she saw my cuts. I started to cry, a lot. I got embarrassed and almost ran away, that's how it always was when people saw my cuts or scars. But she grabbed my hand, it was a funny feeling and the first time I ever really held a girls hand. She told me it was okay and then she hugged me too. That was also the first genuine hug I had ever gotten (honestly my parents didn't/don't give two shits about me.) When we got to the top of the hill, I asked her if she would think differently of me. I remember thinking, *why did I just ask?* and thought about the usual, ""Well duh stupid emo"" or something along those lines. No matter what I hope until the day I die, the way she smiled at me and said that it didn't matter. That it didn't change anything. That she really really liked me. I remember hugging her really really tight, and her hugging me really really tight, and it felt great. I wanted it to last forever. The whole time we walked back to the bottom of the hill we held hands really tight. It was the first time I had smiled for more than fifteen minutes to be honest. When we got to the bottom of the hill she stopped and looked in my eyes like before. She said, ""No matter what you can't never (her grammar is a little shotty at times but I think it's cute) ever hurt yourself like that again."" I remember tearing up a lot, but I was still smiling. I agreed, of course I would! We hugged again and she was off to her house before her parents got mad. The next few months we met up more and more. We talked at school **way** more than before too. She made me [this] () bracelet too so I'd, ""Always be happy"" and to remind me to never break our promise. Over January I met her parents, and even went bowling with them and stuff. They had excepted me, and I felt like I belonged. Fast forward to February, we were hanging out at her house and of course Valentines day was rolling around. It was to the point where everybody knew we had a thing, or were together. At that point we never really made it official, we just had a lot of classes together and we were always together if we could be. By the time Valentines day was upon us I asked her to go for a walk, and I asked her out at the top of the hill. ( Cliche but I'm not creative so whatever lol) Then I had my first kiss! Over March though, things got bad. Her birthday was on the 13th, but I didn't remember it, I made an anti Semitic joke at dinner (turns out her father is Jewish), and we grew apart somehow. I felt sad, but I also didn't. As long as she was happy, and as long as we could still be friends. Over April she began talking to [this] (<URL>) neckbeard guy and we all hung out together a lot. I had moved on to a different girlfriend, but things weren't the same. I think I have to make a continued post sorry. Edit: I FORGOT A PICTURE OF THE BRACELET D:. Oh well on the next post.

The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later. I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get. After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake. After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy. My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow. It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it. I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed. I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? I can't diet because I have no will power. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me. I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way.

I don't have plans to kill myself, I am actively working on my mental health, and that's enough for her. But depending on your situation - diagnosis, age, living arrangements, social history - a therapist can see it as more or less of a red flag based on what they know about you.

s_2958_116,Find evidence for anhedonia in this post,"I feel like my need for meaning is alienating. Do any of you feel this way? Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues. Do any of you feel the same way? Do you have any experiences to share?","I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged.",2455,1,1

September of 2014 I started out weighing about 331 and was just absolutely miserable. Started absolutely hating everything about myself. Couldn't look in a mirror, had about two solid shirts that I would wear and up and quit going out with friends because I was so ashamed. I lived on the margaritas and everything else I could fit into my mouth diet. One day I woke up, looked at myself in the mirror and had a complete breakdown. After that I decided to turn my life around and live to the age of 30. Truthfully, and this will sound stupid but I saw this picture of Chris Pratt and it really, really hit home (<URL>)
Started by writing literally everything I ate down in a journal while also keeping track on my phone. I was a big guy but consistently ate around 1,500 calories a day and between 30-50g of carbs. At the hell out of chicken, kale and eggs. I would walk for an hour every day at an incline and saw dramatic changes. Progress pic: <URL>
Fast forward to now, I've went down three pant sizes and two shirt sizes, dropping down to about 250lbs. I recently started with a personal trainer. He has me doing a mix of resistance/weight training with some weighted cardio mixed in. I meet with him two days a week and do strict cardio by myself on the other days.

As someone who used to think the same thing, I can assure you that they don't. I have atrocious self-esteem (it's getting better, and I'll tell you why), and frequently would go out with my friends and return home feeling like shit because of all the stupid things I've said or done. Focus in every tiny little thing that indicates that someone hated me, even though they'd been friends with me for years. I was utterly convinced that all these people despised me. This was because I deliberately sought out *excuses* to hate myself - evidence to support the warped view I had of myself. I would focus on every little thing I had done, and either blow it way out of proportion (like a joke that wasn't THAT funny, but could have been worse, becoming the most stupid fucking thing I've ever said) or come up with reasons why they actually hate me for it - which are completely unreasonable. I focused on every little bad thing I'd done and completely ignored everything good, or rationalised the good things to actually be a way to hate myself. So all I saw were bad things, all the time. You, I think, are doing the same. My friends, not being severely depressed, only saw the many good things - good jokes, kind gestures, insightful statements, general friend things - and none of the bad, because I hadn't actually done anything wrong. They thought I was cool. But I just couldn't see it, because I was so determined to prove them all wrong and took such pleasure in destroying myself. In summary, I can assure you that people love to be around you. You either don't notice the signs or are deliberately telling yourself they're wrong.

He's been pulled from my room every day for the past week, so I shouldn't have been surprised. Why is this a big deal? Well, because I have a class of 30 kids and he's in charge of our stage crew who are designing costumes, scenery, and props so everyone is involved in the play. Since he keeps getting pulled out, we haven't gotten practice or to finish those things. There was an aide who offered to help, but she didn't finish until 30 minutes after all of the parents and students had arrived to watch the performance. I had to improve while waiting. I ended up leading everyone in nursery rhymes and Simon Says. Not to mention a student cut herself with fabric scissors she found laying around so deeply that she wouldn't stop bleeding for like 10 minutes. I'm sure it wasn't as bad as I thought it was, but it's frustrating planning all of these fun things and then not being ready because admin decides to pull my aide and change the day. I feel like a failure for not being able to figure it out and be ready for what was supposed to be a great day. In the end, it was probably my stress that made the day not as great as it should have been for the kids. I feel like I have failed my kids by not being prepared. THAT is the worst feeling of all.",I feel like a failure for not being able to figure it out and be ready for what was supposed to be a great day.,1349,6,1

s_2815_1699,Find evidence for appetite change in this post,"Teeny-Tiny My doctors asked me to tell my story so other girls like me could read it and learn from my mistakes because Ill be dead soon. That makes me pretty sad to think about. I dont want other girls to be sick like I am. I guess they wont be sick exactly like me, because that would be crazy, but maybe they can read this so they wont make the bad decisions I made. When I was little, Mom used to hold me and say stuff like, Oh Katie, you fit so perfectly on my lap! Youre so teeny-tiny! I loved it. Shed keep me warm and hug me and I felt so great. Id always go to Mom if I felt sad or scared and shed just scoop me up, saying whats wrong, my teeny-tiny girl? and Id tell her what was making me upset and shed always always always make it all better. The most vivid memory I have was the day I turned 10. It wasnt of my party, which I vaguely remember being great, it wasnt the presents, some of which I still have, but it was when Mom had me in her lap that night and had tears in her eyes and said to Dad, Katies getting to be a big girl, huh? I dont remember what my dad said, but there was no denying it: I wasnt her teeny-tiny girl anymore. At 10 years old, I was about 410, maybe 100 pounds. I was growing fast. Both my parents are tall. I remember being scared. The scale kept going up, and by the time I was 11 I was 52, 120 pounds and I started getting boobs. At that point, when I was sad, mom would hug me tight and say the right things, but it all felt different. She never cradled me. She never had me in her lap. I felt cold and lonely even though I was never really cold or lonely. I just wanted to be closer to her like I was when I was little. So I decided to get little again. Mom started to notice when I pushed around my food on the plate, trying to pile it up on one side to make it look like I ate more than I really did. Youre a growing girl, she said, kindly but firmly. You need to eat. I couldnt leave the table until I was done. That night after dinner, I remember lying on my back on the bed, staring at the ceiling and feeling the food in my stomach. Moms words youre a growing girl echoed in my mind and I felt so sick that I ran into the bathroom and threw up. I was really glad I had my own bathroom so they couldnt hear me puking. After I was done, I felt so much better. Lighter and smaller, even. Mom was so happy to see me eating normally again. She had worried aloud that I might be getting the flu, so seeing me chowing down like my old self pushed those worries right out of her head. What she didnt see was how I went to bed afterward and while the bathwater ran I was throwing it all up. I did this every day for years. One of the sad truths about throwing up your meals is that you dont lose all that much weight. I actually gained more. Sure, Id get rid of what Id eaten, but probably twice a week Id be lying in bed, wide awake, fingering my collar bones, hip bones, and ribs, and obsessing over food. Something inside me would snap, and Id run to the fridge or the cabinets and eat until I felt like I was bursting. Then, exhausted, Id go back upstairs and pass out on my bed. Calorie-for-calorie, after those twice-weekly binges I was eating more than I would if I was healthy. Except I really, really wasnt healthy. And nobody knew. All this built up to the last few months after I graduated high school. I was 511, 175lbs. 17 years old. There was absolutely nothing I hated more than my body. I was constantly lonely and wanted to try to take my mind off it all. I decided to get a job. When I told Mom I found a position at a place that recycles old medical gear, she was really proud of me for taking the initiative. It was bittersweet; I knew she was starting to see me as an adult. Not her teeny-tiny girl. I felt like a complete and utter failure. The recycling place where I worked dismantled big machines that hospitals used and sold the parts. I was the receptionist. I took phone calls and helped set up deliveries. The people I worked with were really nice and after a few weeks they gave me a key so I could get there early and have their coffee ready and their work orders printed out. That night, after everyone had left, I went back there and let myself in. I still feel bad about breaking their trust. A couple days earlier my coworkers were bringing in an old machine. They all were wearing heavy gloves and had on breathing gear like scuba divers. When they were done, I asked what it was. Apparently it was something hospitals use to give radiation therapy to cancer patients. I didnt know too much about that, so when I got home I went on Wikipedia and did a lot of research and then I got my idea. When I let myself in that night, the place was empty. I made a beeline for where they had that radiation therapy machine and I investigated it. Most of it was completely dismantled. What I was looking for was conveniently labeled and brightly marked in a massive lead container. It took me a while to get the cover off. Leads so heavy! But after I did, I saw a round metal part that looked like a wheel. I picked it up, rotated the mechanism, and it opened a little window in the front. A faint blue light was inside. I held it up to my eye and looked in. Nothing but that light. I thought it was probably what I was looking for. I brought the object home with me and locked the door of my bedroom. I worked to pry the thing open with a screwdriver but it seemed locked from the inside. Eventually I got frustrated and I turned the wheel again to open the window and pushed my screwdriver into the blue light stuff and tried scooping it out. It turned out to be pretty soft. A lot of it broke as I poked it with the screwdriver, and when I turned the wheel upside down, it tumbled out onto my desk. Now I could see how pretty it was. It was like chunks of glowing blue clay and sand. I gathered it up as best I could and put it away, save for the little bit I was going to use tonight. One of the things Id read about radiation therapy was that it made the poor people with cancer really skinny. They just totally lost their appetites. I couldnt believe it was true. Id always had such a big appetite. I kept telling myself that I need to be really careful when I take this stuff because if I get too much of the radiation I could get cancer myself. I took a pinch of the blue stuff, put it in my mouth, and swallowed it with a gulp of water. It felt warm going down even though the water was cold. Since Id gotten home from the recycling place Id been pretty warm, in fact. Like a little puppy under a blanket. That night I woke up sweating worse than Id ever sweated in my life. The bed was totally soaked. I figured weight loss was weight loss. Water weight wasnt really what I wanted, but it was better than nothing. I took a shower and changed the sheets and went back to bed. My stomach ached a little. When I woke up the next morning, my stomach hurt and I threw up a couple times. But, I wasnt even remotely hungry. That alone made the pain in my tummy pretty much go away. I didnt need to eat! Mom asked if I was bringing leftovers to work from last nights dinner and I lied and said we were going to get a pizza. I hate lying to Mom, but I didnt want her to worry. There was no need to tell her I wasnt hungry. At work, theyd finished disassembling the machine and started sending it out to wherever they send those things. Id been really careful to put the canister back exactly as I left it. No one checked to see if the little wheel was still there. The next few days were uneventful, aside from my stomach ache getting worse and having to puke once or twice. Id barely eaten anything since I started taking the radiation medicine. Whenever I got woozy from lack of food I ate an apple or a fat-free yogurt and I was fine. I was still sweating a lot. When I got on the scale, it said 168. After a week of eating nearly nothing and faithfully taking my radiation medicine nightly, my stomach ache got really, really bad. Id stopped throwing up, but this time it felt like I needed to go to the bathroom. I went, and it was awful. There was so much - I was shocked. Id apparently eaten and kept down more than I thought. It was agony coming out, too. I got on the scale after, though, and that helped me feel a lot better. Over the next couple days, one or two people told me how pretty I looked. They asked me if I lost weight and I said yeah, maybe a few pounds. Over my whole adolescence Id done nothing but get bigger. Now, finally, I was shrinking and on the way to teeny-tiny. I didnt feel too great, though. My tummy was constantly having me run to the bathroom and it still hurt afterwards. I figured I was getting rid of all the extra fat. I was in the shower about 10 days after I started taking the medicine and I was horrified to see some of my hair coming out. That was bad. Really, really, really bad. I stopped washing it immediately and let just the water rinse away the remainder of the shampoo. I got out of the shower and took like an hour blow drying my hair because I was too scared to use a towel that might pull more out. When the mirror was unfogged and my hair was dry, I checked to see how noticeable it was. There was a good-sized patch of bare, red scalp about 2 wide above my left ear. I pushed the hair around it down to cover the patch. Some more fell out. It had to be a nutritional deficiency from all the meals Id been missing. I put on my Titans hat and got dressed. When I brushed my teeth I noticed a little blood in the sink. I made a note to get some multivitamins after work. I didnt shower the next day because when I woke up that morning, there was more hair on my pillow. My scalp was getting pretty visible. It looked prickly and raw but it didnt hurt. Since I was off work I stayed at home and looked online for all the nutritional deficiencies that might cause my hair to fall out and my gums to bleed. Most of the ones were covered by my multivitamin, so I tripled the amount I took just to be on the safe side. I had to go to the bathroom five times during the 15 hours I was awake. By the last time I was incredibly light-headed and so thirsty. I weighed myself before I started downing water and my radiation medicine. The medicine had helped me lose 25 pounds in less than two weeks. Mom hugged me the next morning before I went to work. She ran her hands up and down my back and she remarked about how skinny Id gotten. Then, she said it: remember when I used to call you my teeny-tiny girl? I miss those days but I love you just as much as a grown up. Then she let me go. Pain, nausea, and despair washed over me. All of a sudden, my lightheadedness came back with a vengeance and I stumbled and fell on the kitchen floor. My hat fell off. With my head spinning, I vaguely remember Mom gasping, Katie what happened to your hair?! before I violently threw up on the floor and myself. It was all blood. I passed out to the sound of Mom screaming. I dont know how much time went by at the hospital. I wasnt completely unconscious, but all I remember up until recently when they used drugs to wake me up were images of doctors in the same scuba gear as the guys at work and saying weird words like caesium chloride and sloughed and gray that didnt mean the color. Today, I cant move or talk and Im writing this using a cool keyboard that can pick out letters using the movements of my remaining eye. Like I said in the beginning, Ill be dead soon. Im not too fun to look at anymore. My hairs gone. And my lower jaw. And my skin. The nice doctors are giving me medication that helps me manage the pain and keep me alert. They asked if they could do tests and experiments on me to help understand what ingestion of the radiation medicine does to the human body. Apparently there was a man in Japan a few years ago named Hiroshi Ouchi who got a similar level of exposure and the same stuff happened to him. They said it would help other people in the future if they could compare our two cases. Of course I let them. I cant eat food anymore. My esophagus got cooked away. Same with my stomach. The doctors are keeping me hydrated with a tube in my butt. I dont really like to think about it. I guess all the excitement I get as I wait here is when they weigh me every six hours to see if Im able to retain the fluids they give me or if it all seeps out into the sheets. They hoist me onto a pad and a little machine voice says a number. This morning it said 72. The next time it was 69. Mom and Dad have to wear those scuba suits when they come visit. Moms always crying because shes not allowed to touch me. Dad just stares. Right before I started writing this, Mom bent down and started whispering to me some of the stuff I remember her saying when I was small. I closed my eye and imagined being warm and safe on her lap. I love you, my teeny-tiny girl, she sobbed. I would have smiled if I had a mouth.",I cant eat food anymore.,12045,2,1

I struggle with not being in control and this is one area that I do not cope with the uncertainty and unpredictability of everything. I feel that I am alone in all situations, even though I have a great husband who would manage even if I wasn't there. I am flying back to the UK from the US this week for the funeral, and I am going over all the things that could go wrong. It doesn't really help that in the last month, we have had two deaths in the family, my husband has had to go overseas twice, we have been organizing Thanksgiving, then my daughters birthday, Xmas, and two lots of funeral arrangements. I feel so overwhelmed, but guilty if I ask for help when I am able to let the control go a little. Sorry for the rambling, I just kind of typed as it came into my head.","Overwhelmed, recurring panic attacks, too tired to get my head round the steps I need to take to get 'better'.",0,4,1

Here is Part 2
<URL> So I fought back as much as I could. First I started by prepping the house to be ready to be painted at any moment (I.e. Removing everything from the wall and scooted all furniture away from the walls). Than with a small bottle of holy water and dispersed it around our home. As soon as I finished I began painting the walls white. It is one of the best ways to expelled unwanted evil from a home. It only works if you paint every wall with a fresh coat of white paint. It only works however if you get every single part of the wall. If you were to miss a small section it would render all that you've done useless. It was a trick my Grandfather taught me that I have performed before. I was very thorough on my paint job. I made sure that every single spot on the wall was covered. I was very happy with myself. I knew for sure I had won and we would finally be at peace. Little did I know I missed a very key portion on my paint job, in our living room we have a closet. And inside that closet is a wall that is an exterior wall as well, allowing this evil man under our house a wide open door. We had peace for about 8 months. It was the best 8 months of my life. We were no longer dreading returning home, in fact some days there would be no other place Id rather be. I returned back to school while keeping my job in the Air Force. Up until about a week ago life was great. Thats when everything came to a screeching halt. My girlfriends son had woke up one morning around 5 am and felt that it would be funny to put a pillow over his Grandmothers face (girlfriends mom) and see how long he can hold it there for. My girlfriend and I woke up to a blood curdling scream as her son came running in crying. He told us that his grandmother had thrown him from her bed. Thats when we noticed a faint gasp for air coming from the room. My girlfriends mom was struggling to catch her breath as she told us what had happened. Apparently as my girlfriends son had held the pillow over her face he was saying that the man does not want her in his room anymore. We asked why he would do a thing like that and he said that he didnt want to but the man made him. I felt ice run through my veins as soon as I heard that. He was back. I failed and he is very angry now. That night no one got any sleep, from the exception of my girlfriends son. Her mother had locked her door because she couldnt trust her own grandson anymore. One night had broken our happy family. Fast forward to last week. My girlfriend, her son, and I were on our way to the store to get some groceries. Her son had fallen asleep and it was nice and quiet in the car. We were too tired to talk, we just wanted quite. All of the sudden my girlfriends son had woken up and said in the most monotone voice a 6 year old could have I used to be named Charlie and I was a very bad person, now I am living in my house again. We pulled over as quickly as possible and woke her son up. He had no recognition of what was said and as soon as we said the name Charlie he began to cry and say that is the man that moved my bed and hurt my grandma. My girlfriend has not been the same since. She is completely shelled off from the world and nothing seems to phase her. Every day since we hear things in the house fall off from where it used to sit. Things as small as the remote falling off the counter to dishes and silverware falling out of the sink. About 3 hours ago I woke up to a knock on the door. Three loud thumps. I slowly crept down the stairs and I once again heard another 3 loud thumps. As I got to the front door I peered through the peep hole and saw nothing. So I opened the door all of the way and once again saw nothing. Then from behind I heard another loud thumps, but it was coming from the closet. As I opened it my girlfriends son was standing in there. And he said Charlie is home and he doesnt want you in there! I screamed for my girlfriend and ran upstairs with her son. I woke her up and grabbed my keys and we ran out of Charlies house. As we were leaving all of the water in the house began to run. The sinks, the showers, even the water from the refrigerator was running. And it was hot. Hotter than I have ever been able to make it before. Everywhere the water was running was steaming. Even the refrigerator had been steaming. We begged for her mother to come with us. But it was locked, we were banging on the door yelling her name, but she never answered. I couldnt with all my strength break that door down. It would not bug an inch. We ran to the car and took off. My girlfriends son had been screaming the whole time at the top of his lungs. Were could we go at a time like this, with a child who could not stop screaming. I went to the only place I felt could help me. My grandfathers house. He is the only person I felt that could help us at a time like this. They only lived about 30 minutes from our house, and it was the worse car ride of my life. For 30 minutes straight my girlfriends son screamed at the top of his lungs. My ears were burning and I felt like the ride would never end. As we reached my grandfathers house he came running outside as my girlfriend cried and begged him to help her son. As my grandfather lifted her son out of the car, the screaming immediately stopped. He brought her son into his room and asked if my grandmother and himself could be with him alone for a few hours and asked us to wait in the living room. Its almost been three hours since weve heard anything from them. And cannot get ahold of my girlfriends mother. We are sitting in a dimly lit living room. I feel dead on the inside. I hope my grandfather can help and that its not too late. I will post an update as soon as I can.",I was very happy with myself.,889,9,1

For example, i have a friend that i knew something wasn't right from the start. We would chat, like how friends do but every time after we chatted I will feel really sad and influenced. Not just sad, in particularly, but a mix of weird negative feelings that I have no idea where they came from till now. But i ignored. I tolerated and just ""let it be"". I also pretended that I am totally okay with her and that she's a really nice friend. I wrote letters to her, remembered her birthday and other important things about her and always gave the most heartwarming wishes I could. I bought presents for her too. It's been almost a year since we knew each other now, and i still have that bad feeling every time after we chatted. I tried to sort out this problem with her, but she got mad and offended really quickly that i didn't dare to say anything more and just decided to continue to tolerate.

s_2257_110,Find evidence for psychomotor in this post,"Multiple issues including OCD,ADHD,Bipolar and BPD? First of all: I am a university student on weekends and I am doing a full time job on weekdays. I am in my mid twenties. I still live with my parents and I don't own any vehicle of my own. The usual length of the university degree I am following is 4 years, and this is my 6th year, because I still have failed subjects and I am trying to retake them and graduate as soon as possible. The job I work on does not suit me, I mean I am bored and I seldom feel interested in the work I do. Why do I still hang around in the job? It pays me (considerably lower than the usual pay but it still pays something) and I want to be independent of my parents. They have paid for my university degree too, and I feel like I should take care of my expenses by myself. I am scared that I'd be a burnout, because I am bored to death of everything in my life. I feel that I have more than one mental health issue: anxiety, depression most likely, and OCD, ADHD(or ADD) and possibly Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder. Also, I believe I am addicted to porn and social media and junk food. Let me explain the rationale behind my conclusions. Anxiety and depression: Pretty sure, because I often am nervous when carrying out even the simplest tasks and interacting with others (even my family members), and I love my comfort zones like my bed and my room and I feel uneasy whenever I have to leave them. I feel overwhelmed among crowds and I tend to avoid crowded places. It's kinda funny, because I have a thing for singing, and it usually requires performing in front of a crowd. I have done it very few times, and needless to say, I felt very anxious and hard to perform. I cannot handle pressure, especially when there are deadlines. Though I think this is related to ADHD as well. I think I have depression because I am sad most of the time. It's just I don't see many reasons to be happy about in my life right now. I tend to overthink even the smallest and silliest things, and then the end goal is feeling distraught. I spend a lot of time on Social media or daydreaming or sleeping because I feel bored by my university work and office work. I lack enthusiasm to do even the daily tasks like taking a shower or brushing teeth. OCD : I have a habit of repetition of things, washing my hands a lot and checking out if the door is locked immediately after I've locked the door, I feel the need of organizing trivial things. When I see my room unorganized, it really bugs me. So I think this conclusion is pretty justified. I have an acne issue on my skin and I cannot stop myself from picking on scabs and I believe OCD is one of the reasons that I cannot get rid of acne. ADHD or ADD : This one I recently got to know. I have issues in focusing and attention. I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long. if a tas requires a lot of organizing, I spend a lot of time getting ready for that and sometimes try to avoid it altogether. I get easily distracted by surroundings and sometimes my own thoughts. I often doze off in group conversations, this has become a big problem because this happens a lot in office video calls and I don't remember what topics were discussed during the call. I suck at time management and prioritizing my work. I can be forgetful. Bipolar : I have rapid mood swings; one second I'm happy and the next I'm not. I get irritated easily, for simple to no reasons. Sometimes I am really energized up and sometimes I'm lethargic. Sometimes I can talk with someone else for more than one hour and sometimes I don't feel like talking at all. BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) : I feel like either I have more than one personality or I have none whatsoever. I find my interests vary from time to time: for example sometimes I feel like I love football, and sometimes I don't find it very exciting. I have different kinds of thoughts and feelings and they can change rather quickly. So are my interests. I feel like a lot of debate going inside my head on different topics. Maybe this isn't actually BPD. A few interesting self-observations: I have had suicidal thoughts before, and I have acted on them once and failed. I still get them from time to time. I sometimes feel like I am not afraid of death anymore (I used to be scared of death all the time), as long as the way of dying is painless and quick, it's just I have stopped worrying about afterlife. Main reason I am still staying here is that I have a responsibility to my family and I have to take care of them, otherwise I would have actually turned this off long ago. I have seen this thing called cycles when expressing depression, which I haven't really experienced. It's like my whole life recently has been one big singular cycle which never ends. Social media addiction : I use WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Reddit and I spend a lot of time surfing through them and I cannot control it. Porn addiction : I usually watch porn and masturbate at least once a day and I feel like it's affecting my sleep cycle. My sleep cycle is in disarray. Junk food : Perhaps this is stress eating. I cannot go by myself for a few hours without having a snack or some junk food or a drink (Non alcoholic). I find it incredibly difficult to tackle with 1 of them, because something else from the above list can intervene and make it harder. I once met a psychologist or a psychiatrist and I tried to explain the whole thing to him, but he dismissed my claims and I felt really really hurt after that. I mean I have already paid, why couldn't he listen to me? Because of that, and for obvious anxiety reasons, I find it hard to actually meet a psychiatrist again. So, if you made it to the end, props to you. What do you think?",I cannot concentrate on projects and have trouble sitting in one place for long.,2817,4,1

The man trembled, but spoke for us. "" Sir, I've been locked up at gunpoint, given endless scans, sent into supernatural darkness, seen my squadmates torn apart and then delivered back to me, put up with endless evil sermons, even shot a friend because a mosquito got in his brain. I'm *tired* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die."" The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. "" You all feel this way?"" Nods followed. He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. "" If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not."" Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd. As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. "" Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each."" A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the moment so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun. I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built. It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make. But my two hours would feel like forever. I sat in there, sweating, frying, melting for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanity down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox. The Sword wasn't going to let us leave. It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence? What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us? I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated. I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hope
But the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in. I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same. As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face was absolutely filled with hate for that thing and I couldn't blame her but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me. It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. "" I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised."" She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. "" I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. "" This is crazy it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?"" Her gaze went distant for a moment. "" No I don't, actually."" ""Will you get one?"" I asked, desperate. She nodded. "" You're thinking neural mosquito?"" ""I'll manage it,"" she promised quietly. "" Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation."" I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave out and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn. There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heat crying. We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible. Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day. I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell. She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand. ""What'd you get?"" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up. She shook her head and showed me. "" He's clean."" ""*What?*"" ""Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering."" I remember sobbing uncontrollably. "" ""I'm sorry,"" she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. "" But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal."" She paused. "" But if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls."" I could only screw up my face and nod. And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out. There was no chatter, no murmurs no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way. It was on that day that we finally reached our objective. I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darkness
And it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides. ""Any contact with the Preacher yet?"" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays. Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack it and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night. The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place. As we watched, it shifted. Another place and another seconds later, another
This was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something* and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears. We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all. ""All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears."" This time, I knew who spoke. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: ""No, sir."" Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. "" We refuse."" ""*The Preacher must die!*"" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static. Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort of revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely? ""Set your charges,"" I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened. We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was. We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would. Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary. The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble. Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives. He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. "" Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives."" ""There's hardly time,"" someone said. ""Reed,"" the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. "" Shoot that man in the leg."" ---

I told a [story about my stupid sister](<URL> sh=d65e3411), then [my gross brother](<URL> sh=33e9ea48), then my [poor hot gay friend Kevin](<URL> sh=30c286c6). If you dont know those stories, I kinda hate you because theyre really important and like who the h*ck do you think you are coming in here and acting like youre going to read about my first time and not care about the other things that are happening in my life? You should go, like, assistant manage a small diner or something just as sad lol. Omg anyway guess what? IM GONNA TELL YOU A STORY!! :D
This is gonna sound soooooo creepy and weird but youll read it anyway because Im awesome and its fun to read stuff about people who are better than you lol. Omg btw I love Katniss Evergreen. But yeah dont worry its not like it was my uncle or anything gross like a dog or hippo or something. Ok so maybe like 18 months ago this really cute guy snuck into my room. You know how vampires have to get invited into your room before they can come in your room and visit you in your room? Yeah this wasnt like that because he wasnt a vampire. This guy just kinda came in through the window and sat on the side of my bed. I was like what are you doing here and got all mad because I didnt have my hair right and I was wearing my ugly fleecy pants instead of my hot fleecy pants and he was okay looking but not like stupid Kevins hot dumb brainless head but I didnt know Kevin back then so he was better than okay I guess. I wanted to call Dad to come beat the guy up but there was something about him that was kinda cool. He was like gray like a rock or a cloud or gay poetry stuff and had cool red eyes and a really big mouth. He started rubbing my hair which was annoying but I couldnt move for some reason then he whispered in my ear:
Madison youre going to be a mom someday. Then his fingers got really long and skinny and he put them behind my eyes. I was like um gross and no thank you but I didnt say it because I still couldnt move and then everything got all dark and I woke up kinda sore and stuff. And ew not there. And thats the story! You guys are lucky Im good at setting a mood otherwise that wouldve seemed even weirder and creepier than it was. But yeah, that was my first time with the gray man. Wanna know why Im telling you all this? Obv you do lol. Welllllllllllllllllll GUYS IM GONNA BE A MOM!!! Ok ok ok you cant tell my parents but its not like they can see the little baby yet anyway because its growing behind my eyes but I can already feel its tiny little hands pushing on the eye cords or whatever theyre called. Good thing Im not ticklish lol. Theres only one person I told and thats poor gay Kevin so I could make him feel jealous but he just kinda drooled and said uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhh because hes annoying but so hot but I know he wished he was the one who put it in me and not the gray man. Its funny because Id forgotten all about the gray man until the little baby started growing over the weekend! Itd been years and I thought babies were made in nine months and in a uterus but mine is gonna be cool so thats why its different. Another weird thing - Ive always always always hated babies! I was so happy when my little brother died and until he came back I had to hear him crying and stuff every time I bent his knee back when Mom or Dad wasnt looking. But now, Im so excited to be a mom. What could be better than another little Madison running around? Literally nothing, thats what. Im going to be the coolest mom. Ill let my baby have parties and vape and talk to Black God and wear whatever she wants and never have to learn Spanish if she doesnt want. Check this out - when Gina died it was exactly one year after the gray man came to visit. I never even connected that! I was so excited to have my bedroom all to myself I didnt even think of the dates being the same! Btw guys it is SO COOL to still have a room to myself and I wont even mind sharing with the baby. But yeah at school I didnt want to tell people about the baby except Kevin but get this! Karen said something bad about my hair and said it wasnt really blonde but brown like Im an Italian or something and I got real mad and all of the sudden a little baby hand came out of my eye and cut Karens throat open lol. NOBODY saw it happen, either! Karen was laughing at me and then her neck was all shooting blood and stuff and she died and everyone was sad and I pretended to be sad but I wasnt sad even though I have to go to a little vigil and say Im sad.

Spoiler: gt;!This is a tragic update! lt; Trigger Warning: gt;!Suicide! lt; [ORIGINAL](<URL>) by [u/ThrowRAihatemymom](<URL>) **Mom(40F) cheated on Step-Dad(45M) and ruined my(16M) and my siblings' lives** I am a 16 years old male. I have 2 sisters (10F,8F). Our biological father was never in our lives. He left my mom when she was pregnant with me, came back 6 years later and said he wanted to make amends and that we could be a happy family. Somehow my mom immediately started saying that she loved him but he left after mom got pregnant again. Then 2 years later he came back, I cried and begged my mom to not let him into our lives because I hated him. Well, he said the same thing, my mom also said she loved him and then he left after she got pregnant again. My mom was a waitress so the 4 of us lived in a small one bedroom apartment. I was essentially another parent to my sisters because mom was always working. Sometimes, we wouldn't eat breakfast or dinner because we couldn't afford it. Other times, I did not eat anything so that my sisters could eat. My mom met another man (45M) a year after my youngest sister was born. He is a really good man. His wife and daughter had died in an accident a long time ago when he was in his 20s. He met my mom when he was ready to date again. He is a really good man and treated us like his own children and I consider him my father. He was very wealthy and owned multiple businesses. We eventually moved into his huge mansion like house. I also had a better school there. We 3 siblings got our own rooms and I got better clothes, played video games for the first time in my life and a bunch of other things. He taught me things, helped me catch up in school because I could not do well in the previous school. He spent a lot of time with the 3 of us. My sisters eventually started calling him ""dad"". I followed shortly after. I remember him crying, hugging us and telling he loved us when we called him dad for the first time. They eventually got married and dad asked me to be one of his groomsmen and of course, I said yes while my sister were my mom's bridesmaids. Mom stayed at home to take care of us. As far as I know, they were very happy together. They went on dates at least once in 2 weeks, kissed each other frequently and always told each other that they loved each other. He also knew about mom's past and realized she had issues and got her into counselling. I was really happy that my mom had finally found someone who treated her well. I was also very happy for myself and my siblings and really loved him. He also said that he would pay for college for the 3 of us. My dream is to become a doctor and I never thought it would be possible cause it was so expensive so and I was so freaking happy. Mom also told me she was very lucky to have found him and that she loves him and is very grateful of how he has made her and our lives better. Well, last year July dad discovered that my mom was having an affair with his best friend who was also the best man at their wedding. Apparently, the affair was going on for a long time, I do not know exactly how long. Mom cried and begged him to give her another chance. He didn't, understandably. He let us keep all the new things such as clothes for me and toys for my sisters. When I went to him crying and asking him why he was leaving us he just hugged me and told me about mom's affair. He said the affair is too painful and that he cannot be in this marriage anymore and then said that he loved me and my sisters. My sisters do not know about the affair, I do not think they will understand. He got a prenup so mom did not get anything that wasn't hers. Dad just had to pay the rent of a new apartment until the divorce was finalized. We stayed in a decent apartment but after the divorce was done we moved into a much smaller apartment. I tried to be in contact with him but it does not seem like he wants a relationship with me. He has never responded to my messages. I sent a final letter to him last year December thanking him for everything he did for me and my sisters and that I loved him and would remember him forever. So now we're back to a one bedroom apartment, skipping meals and barely being able to afford anything. I sleep on the floor now. My sisters share a bed while my mom uses another. Mom is a waitress again. I've also taken a part time at a grocery store to help with money. I just hate my mom so much right now. I only took the job to help my sisters. I have also stopped talking to mom. Recently she came crying to me and told me that she was sorry for ruining everything and she wanted me to talk to her. I broke down and just said ""I don't understand. Why did you cheat on him? He was taking such good care of you and the 3 of us. He was also gonna send us to college. For the first time in my life, I was happy. You have destroyed my life. Why do you always have to ruin everything? You already did that twice when you let \[bio father\] back in my life. I hate you. I never want to talk to you again"" She was crying a lot after I said that. I am gonna admit, what I said was pretty rude but at that time I was just so angry. I just hate her so much right now. I just wish she dies a very painful death. These thoughts are the only things in my head. It's making me go insane and I know it's not normal. I read online that therapy would be useful but we can't even afford food on most days so we don't have insurance. All I can think about is how she ruined everything. He didn't even ask for much. Mom was living such a luxurious life and was just at home taking care of her own biological children. I just miss him so much. Even my sisters keep asking when they are going back home or when they'll see dad again. They've also started crying and asking for dad a lot of times this past year. I just don't know what to do anymore. I am so frustrated and just angry at everything. I wish I could run from here but if I did who would take care of my siblings. That stupid mother can't do shit. I guess I'm here cause I need some help. I don't really know what to do. Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything. Other days I just wished I died and all of this ended. [UPDATE](<URL>) **My Mom(40F) Committed Suicide Because Of Me(16M)** Hello everybody. This is a throwaway account. About 2 weeks ago, I found my mom dead in our house. She had sent my siblings (10F,9F) to their friend's house and then hung herself. She really changed after she got divorced from my step dad after she cheated on him (I made a post about it recently). My mom and I didn't talk a lot after that. One of the last things I told her was that I hated her and asked her why she ruined my and my sisters' lives. I wish I didn't say that. Maybe she would have been alive if I supported her. I have had no contact with my step dad after the divorce. My sisters and I live with my mom's sister and her husband now. We never met them before this and even my mom never had contact with them but they are the only family that could be found and they agreed to let us live with them. My siblings and I don't like living here. Both of them are constantly shouting at each other and at us. We're just so uncomfortable here. I don't think they can afford food for all of us. I have a job at a grocery store so I mostly buy food for my siblings. My boss is also very nice and allows me to take home some extra things for free. I really miss my mom. My sisters are also always crying for her. She had her flaws but I still love her. She's my mom. The last thing I told her was that I hated her. I just wish that I told her that I love her and supported and helped her. Then she would've been alive today. What I told her tipped her over the edge. I can't do any of this anymore. I just don't know anything anymore.","Some days, I'm just so tired and don't want to do anything.",6182,5,1

Long and heart wrenching story short, my bestfriend, who was my boyfriend for a very long time up until he tried to kill himself a month ago and came back saying he wanted a break because he might be gay. Well, today, walking to lunch, I saw him holding this girl M's hand... I don't know what came over me, but I screamed ""I can't! and ran into the bathroom, where coincidentally my best friend Chloe had been. I started screaming and crying and, apparently, I said ""I just want to die"" a few times. M, who has actually been making mine and his life a living hell for months, came in and started yelling at me, saying ""What the fuck is wrong? Is it because w were holding hands? He's gay, get over it!"" and I just died inside at that point, because, if he really is gay, I'm losing everything I had at one point, indefinitely. I guess I kept asking her to stop but she wouldn't so Chloe made her leave, and while Chloe was gone, I threw up all over myself while I cried.

I explained how awful it is, since I used to mean everything to him and now I feel like I mean nothing at all to him. He said, and I quote ""I never meant to push anyone out, especially not you. You still mean a lot to me. Like, a lot, I just..."" I then said ""Do we have a chance anymore, J?"" to which he responded to by shrugging and saying ""I don't know."" and then he gave me a hug and I whispered ""I'm sorry"" into his neck and he just gave me the saddest look I've ever seen and went into art textiles...
I know he really doesn't know. He's not saying it because he doesn't have the guts to say no. He's just extremely fucking confused with everything at the moment. This is the first time since he got back that I've actually expressed that this is effecting me negatively, and I didn't even really express it to him.

But it's also frustrating to get through my own first month and only have lost 10 pounds. I've basically plateaued since after the first week. I've had a couple of cheat meals (one being yesterday), and it seems like it takes my weight forever to get back on track even though I'm pissing dark pink on the sticks and have smelly breath. I posted a comment not too long ago about waiting to exercise until I'm down some more weight, but I decided with my current frustration to change my mind. I'm starting some light weight training tonight with my husband. I'm giving up most of the artificially sweetened things that were staples of my beginning keto diet. I have to remind myself that my progress will probably be slower than others', since in the past 18 months I've lost 50 pounds and gained 30 back. I know yo-yo dieting has an effect on speed of weight loss, as well as my PCOS (and, therefore, insulin resistance), hypothyroidism, and IBS. One thing I will say for certain that I'm very pleased with: my sugar addiction is gone. It was so bad before I got married and started keto that about twice a month I would have this enormous craving for cookies or cake and go to Wal-Mart to fulfill my desires. For those of you with insulin resistance and former sugar addiction, you know this craving was basically insatiable. You'd go, eat half the carton of oreos (or even the whole carton if it was a particularly bad one) and then feel like death was coming afterwards. Now, I have that deathy feeling even after a small cheat. I get tired, my eyes go cross, my anxiety creeps back up on me. It's horrendous. This morning, for example, I feel like death and an overly inflated balloon. I had one of my sister's famous brownies yesterday and I felt like hell the rest of the day.

The doc thought it would help to keep increasing the dose, but finally I said I don't think increasing the dose would help a lot.

s_481_30,Find evidence for worthlessness in this post,"[17/m] I'm in a triangle with two friends and it's driving me insane, would love some advice :) So I've been friends with this girl I really like, and long story short, I really think I love her. I know it sounds stupid af, but just hear me out. I've never even tried to be in love because I'm so scared of a broken heart. Then she came along, and we became friends. We hang out a lot after school and text. We even have the gold heart thing on Snapchat. It sounds cringy, I know, just hang in there :D
On Snapchat, she sends me pictures where she clearly poses and takes the time to make them look good. Some of my friends actually thinks we're dating, but we're not. I say some because I think she likes another guy, and he happens to be my close friend. While she acts like she likes me (she must just be really polite idk), she's more physical with him (he sits in her lap and sleeps on her shoulder). I've also seen her drawings of him playing the piano (she's a really good artist). He's a really good guy, and if there is a thing between those two, I would hate to be a jerk to either of them and get in the way. We're both (the other guy and me) really good at the piano and we both play video games. I guess I have more in common with her than he does cuz we (the girl and me) love to write and watch anime (the other guy doesn't do either). All three of us are pretty weird though even though we're all well liked as people at school. The problem is that I actually really like her. I've never felt this way with anyone and I sometimes feel like I'm accidentally gonna blurt out ""I love you."" This whole unofficial love triangle has been going on for months now, and it's driving me insane. The one time I actually feel emotionally invested in someone, I know it's just a dead end because I have a long history of losing. The other part of me wants to desperately win because I don't think I'll ever find someone quite as unique as her. I might get close and I might find other unique people, but she's special. Bottom line, I think I'm being led on, and she's going to eventually fall in love with him. I'm just so freaking terrified by this because I know it's going to break my heart. And isn't that why I never tried to get close with a girl before? I have planned my final attempt. If this doesn't win her heart, then I'm dropping it, and I'll deal with the sadness. I wrote her a song that's not specifically addressed to her, but she'll realize at the end who I'm referring to. I already booked a slot in the upcoming Valentine's Day assembly at school so I'm pretty set on doing this. Other than that, do you think that I should just drop it?

So i figured a year or two later I'd go to india and start the search. But apparently going to India and finding a wife at age 24 is too young. While my college friends had already went and gotten married. So i figured id wait till girls in India were ready. Now that im 27 its probably the right time but now I just feel like theres a huge barrier. Because im having a very hard time connecting with girls lol. I've kind of lost my self esteem and confidence because I have no control over this process. My parents were just very adamant on getting me hitched with this one girl because her family was good. But i just wasnt attracted to her so I just pushed it off cause there wasnt any other choices. And any other choices that did come up then my parents would just find reasons for why I shouldnt marry her. So it was a pain. Few months ago I showed them someone that I was interested in and they were very pissed off and started emotionally black mailing me so I just said heck with it and told them to start the search again. So right now im in a limbo state of what I want to do. There are girls in India but I have a very hard time connecting with them. I cant match up with their standards and they cant match up with mine. I wouldnt mind dropping my standard if the girl was someone I knew, could relate to, etc but its very hard when u have to go based on a biodata and then have the uncles in india do a background search and then finally, maybe... get to talk to her. Though usually its their parents u talk to first. Lol its just a complete mess of a system. Growing up in an indian community and having lived in india for 7 yrs i thought i would be able to understand, relate and work with the system. But honestly its just a horrible system. Its really a quasi marketplace where you're bartering each other. Maybe this is a approach that keeps the family stable in the long run. But im not sure if it keeps the family happy in the long run. Plus lol i sent an email to one of the fathers and he replied back with ""how long r u in us? Whats ur salary?"" I didnt mind most of the questions but how can you so easily ask for someones salary. I havent even talked to ur daughter and know if she and I will get along. Lol its just ridiculous. Plus, most girls in India dont really want to go to US.

Its been about 8 months since I'm on many prescriptions. But i don't think its helping me. I'm still depressed. I constantly get suicidal ideation. My Mental state isnt improving. I feel like its getting worse. I did some research on my symptoms. I know self diagnosis or even looking these up arent good for my treatment, or so i have been told. But the first time i was diagnosed i insisted my parents to take me to a psychiatrist as my health was getting worse(physical and mental). Also Mental health is a taboo in my country. And my parents don't even believe in this. My sibling also has clinical depression and anxiety and he also got treatment (after me. He is older). So, i think i have more than just depression and anxiety. Maybe adhd or bpd. I often think i have autism. I dont feel whole. I always feel like there is a void in my life that i can't fill.

There were two mice, siblings, and their mother. I had been looking after these mice all day, but they kept on running away. My day had consisted of myself looking for these two tiny mice. Just the siblings. Sometimes I'd find them, and they'd get away again. I had to look after them, that was really important. When they were lost I had to find them. I don't know what happened to the one. But I was with people, and they asked me if I was hungry. So they went and got fish 'n' chips while I sat on a wall, looking on the floor for two mice. I hadn't seen them for a long time - and I was very worried. Eventually the others returned and they passed me a folded up paper bag. I opened it up and out popped this nose shape. A tiny mouse shaped nose. But it had been battered and deep fried - like a fish. I know that sounds fucking stupid. But as this tiny orange nose-shape poked out it hit me that it was the mouse. And then it hit me again that someone had fucking deep fried it. Had probably boiled it alive and battered it. And then someone had given it to me. Knowing full well I was meant to look after them. I forgot about it in the morning. In midday I was reminded, I nearly broke down into tears.

s_2237_1043,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"My best friend/wife killed herself 2 years ago and I wish my anger would go away. This story is a bit long so you may want to grab a snack and a drink. We will call her Jenny for this. When I first met Jenny, she was my girlfriends best friend. My girlfriend accused me of having sex with Jenny, and broke it off. I DID NOT have sex with her. I was struggling with my own sexuality at the time. I had not been having sex with my girlfriend for some time. My girlfriend made this accusation upon returning from traveling to Alabama with her ex boyfriend. I'm not stupid; they fucked. And more power to them... I certainly wasn't doing it and had to think about dicks to even try. Yep... I'm gay I remember realizing. I remember telling myself, Fuck it who cares just be gay, dude. Jenny and I became good friends after this ordeal. When I met Jenny she seemed mature beyond her years but that maturity came with a child like innocence. Sometimes objects would entrance her. She would examine it closely and pick out the smallest details and appreciate their beauty. All this while having reddit open, and learning about particle physics at the same time. Oh and don't forget the octopus hat. I loved her so deeply. In a non-romantic way. Jenny had problems in her past. Her family was not very supportive of her. I think they just didn't know what to do. Jenny dropped out of highschool,after an off the record meeting with the school counselor; in which she was advised that she should do so. The school didn't know what to do with her either. Later I encouraged her to get her GED (good enough diploma) so that she could at least get into a local college. In order to take her, I got fired from my job for calling in sick and not providing a requested Doctors note. Fuck that job anyway, this shit was important. Jenny was highly, highly intelligent. She could figure anything out. She absorbed all available data that she could. Johnny Five seriously yo. Jenny had problems socializing with others. She liked big gatherings of people, but preferred to stay off to the side and observe while talking with the one or two people she felt comfortable with. After a while Jenny lost her job. She was fired for poor customer service. After that we did not have enough money to pay the bills. And I detected agitation... or an increasing anxiety in her. I knew she needed a doctor, but we had no insurance. So I said to Jenny, Why don't we just get married at the courthouse. I'll join them military and you'll get medical insurance. And she agreed. So that is what we did. At first it was great. Jenny was excited about us moving. Which was surprising to me because she did not like changes to her environment. But she was okay with this. Then, I got deployed.... while I was away, Jenny began reading the news about the war. Her agitation increased because she was completely dependent on me. What would she do if I died? Where would she work if she couldn't talk to people? And the news kept getting worse. She kept reading all the links on reddit about government programs spying on us citizens. About how people could hack into kinect and listen to what you're saying and watch you. About how the government could tap into your cellphone and listen to the mic anytime it wanted.....
Deeper and deeper into anxiety she sank. Her ability to absorb data was astounding. She would literally have hundreds of tabs open on her browser; and know what each tab contained. So all this dark bad news she absorbed. When I got back, I discovered half completed wall paint projects all over the house. I discovered unwashed gagging stink in the sink, of old ramen noodles, while the rest of the house was immaculately clean. The military medically retired me for the injuries I sustained from my time in Iraq. She continued to refuse to see a doctor. But after 2 years of random raging emotional meltdowns, she finally agreed to go. Oh my goodness the meltdowns. Her screaming and raging about how I shouldn't have a smartphone. The government is listening. She would bury her cellphone under blankets and insisted that we have double firewalls on the internet. Oh and she smashed up the kinect and the entire Xbox after reading hackers could see you. The psychologist did some aptitude tests and other tests. The psychologist called me in to discuss the findings. Jenny was in the highest percentile for intelligence. She should have been inventing fusion reactors....
But Jenny was also autistic. Used to be called Asberger's syndrome but doctor said that was not a real thing and its just called Autism. The only experience I had with autism was meeting the cousin of a friend of mine.... this kid was in his own world and didn't talk. But the doctor explained Jenny was had a high functioning autism. Around this time, I was to the point in my recovery that I wanted to use my 911 GI Bill to go to school. Jenny had revealed that she just wanted a house in the mountains somewhere with no internet and lots of books. The psychologist agreed that this might be the best thing for Jenny as her anxiety was virtually uncontrollable. Jenny refused any type of medication. OK so I will go get that house in the mountains for you. I needed to go to school and I wanted to work in ecology for national parks which are being overrun with invasive species of plants. So I found a school that was perfect for me in Washington State. The psychologist explained that Jenny needed to learn how to be independent. So I was given the okay by the doctor that Jenny would be fine if I left to go to school on the other side of the country. The doctor said she would monitor Jenny closely, and have social workers check in on her at home. So I went. I was gone for about one month. The day before school was to start, Jenny had a massive meltdown. Screaming over the phone at me how I abandoned her. This hurt so bad. I was doing this so that I could obtain the income to move her to the place she wanted in the mountains. She kept screaming, FUCK YOU! And then she hung up the phone. She had done this many many times before. Often not speaking to me or answering my calls for days aftwards. So I called the doctor and asked her to check in on Jenny. The doctor said she would go visit in two days because she was out of the state. The social worker was not answering her phone either. So I went to the orientation at the school the next morning. Jenny was still mad; not answering her phone. While washing my face in the bathroom I remember thinking, What if she killed herself? And then to my horror I said aloud, That would be a relief. Then I cried for 20 minutes for having thought that. I loved Jenny so much. I just wanted her to be happy. To recapture that innocence and wonder she had. To live life without mistreatment from others. I remember going and sitting outside her job at the mall and watch as the customers would abuse her. There was just something about the way she acted that invited people to scream at her and be rude. I interfered with one telling the customer to back off. Security then said I had to leave the mall and banned me. Fuck them, those motherfucking asshat security fucks with their plastic badges and stupid hats they wear indoors. That fat fuck couldn't see I was defending a family member against an aggressor. Dumb fat fuck, with the front of his mall cop uniform untucked because his belly was jiggling below it like it was jello. I had to leave home because the orientation day was going to start. So I went to school and tried calling every chance I got. No answer. But she's done this before. I kept telling myself she would be okay. But that evening, I could not take it anymore. So I called the police and asked if they would go check on her. The cop arrived at the house and called me on the phone. He said there was no answer but he could see the rice cooker light on through the window and the car was still there. I told him to bust the glass on the door and enter the house. He said okay and that he would call me back. Five minutes passed. A goddamn eternity it was. I called the cops phone. No answer. Ten minutes passed. Fucking cop won't answer the phone. Twenty minutes passed. Surely its something really bad he found if he's not calling or answering his phone. So I call the neighbor. Neighbor says that I better talk to the cop but its not good. With that information I tell myself. Jenny is dead. Finally the cop calls. He says, I'm sorry sir I have to inform you that your wife is dead. She hung herself. The body is cold so we did not try CPR. An ambulance is on its way. We then hung up. I couldn't believe it. I blamed myself for saying what I did that morning. I thought somehow that is what caused this. Even though we were not sexually involved, we were still married and therefore partnered in nearly everything. She was my best friend. She was just an innocent bunny. I dropped from school, returned home to clean out the house. And I saw it.... the hole in the wall above the closet. And then I realized why I could not find my German Shepherd Dog's leash. Jenny hung herself with it. And then I wept some more for about an hour. Walking around the now empty house. I was abandoning it. I could not live there but could not afford to pay the mortgage and rent on a different place at the same time. So I let it foreclose. But anyway. I remember walking around in circles, in her bedroom, weeping and looking at the hole in the wall. I just wanted Jenny back. Sometimes almost believed that any second she'll come walking in while talking way too loud about some kitten picture she saw on reddit or showing me yet another printout of Einstein's face that she photoshopped onto a kitten. I cried like I never cried before. I was slobbery, snot drenched, hot weeping mess. And then suddenly it stopped. And I was no longer sad but instead mad at Jenny. And I'm still angry. It was just such a waste. She was so damn smart. Should have been giving gifts to all humanity with her scientific discoveries. And she just quit life like that. She didn't give a fuck about how anyone else would feel about her suicide and just left. No note or anything left behind. What in the FUCK Jenny??????? And for 2 years I haven't told anyone about this anger or shown it. I just say that I am glad she is not suffering anymore. And I hope she's chilling with Einstein right now. My life has moved on, I am now using my pension to do humanitarian work in the Philippines. But dammit I'm still so mad at her. I wish I could feel something other than anger. Because I loved her and now she's gone. She just fucking quit and left. So that's it. Its off my chest I guess. Not really. I'll just bottle this back up and bury it inside like I always do. I'll just press on with life and keep my anger a secret from everyone else. And in private I'll say my usual, God fucking dammit Jenny. What the fuck? My prayer. TLDR:Please go fuck yourself, Lazy. :p. I asked nicely...
Edit: what's with all the fucking hate mail? I followed the doctors advice. I also sacrificed my life to take care of someone who's family abandoned her. I'm no saint... but at least I made sure she was fed, warm, and dry. I gave her everything she ever asked for and more. If you don't have the fucking balls to say shit here for public scrutiny then you're just a chicken shit pansy. Grow some balls. (Wait no those are weak) grow a vagina and then shove a watermelon out of it. Now you're a man. Wait.... what? Edit2: writing this was incredibly therapeutic. It's like something has been squeezing my heart and it just let go. I cried for the first time since i was in the bedroom looking at the hole above the closet. I will choose to be thankful for all the octopus hat wearing Einstein as a kitten moments. I'm still not fully okay. .. probably never will be. But at least the heart squeezing is gone.

s_1514_858,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I have a very strange curse, but I think I'm making the best of it You could say I've always been a bit of a miser. The thing is, it's not money that I pinch. Ever since I was a boy, I've made it a priority to spend my time as efficiently as possible. Build a sandcastle for five minutes. Play two rounds of tag in ten minutes. Rest, three minutes. Fun complete, time for chores. Needless to say, the other kids found me rather odd but I didn't let that stop me. Once I was a little older, I got a job as soon as I could, and poured all my time into working. With the inherent ethic that I had, it was easy to impress my managers. Even at my young age, I was surely in line for a promotion. Except I worked, day in and day out, and the first promotion came and went. They gave it to some new guy who laughed a lot, talked loudly and inappropriately, and went out for drinks with them often. No big deal, I thought. It was an obvious case of favoritism. Makes sense. I'll wait for the next. Of course, as we all know, the depression hit, and promotions stopped being a thing. I took a second job at a deli to increase my chances of getting somewhere, and began working eighty hour weeks, all with the extreme efficiency I'd always applied to everything in my life. I was slowly getting more and more tired, yes, but I often got impressed comments from my managers. Years *years* went by, as we all know, and the economy never got better. Still, life had to go on eventually, and promotions began happening again as those higher up moved on in various ways. I was passed over again, several times, at both jobs. A cold bitterness began gnawing at the back of my tired eyes as I hustled and bustled each day. I could blame someone, perhaps. I could be angry, or resentful, like my coworkers. Or, I could work even harder. I began working overtime at both jobs, and sleeping less. To say I was dead tired would be an understatement - but nobody noticed, given my carefully calculated work habits and efficiency. Then, it happened. ""Keep this up, and you're next in line for a promotion!"" my manager said offhandedly on one chilly Friday evening. I smiled and nodded and secretly burned with hope and rage. It was what I wanted, but how could I possibly keep this up? I could feel my body and mind falling apart as the exhaustion deepened in every fiber and nerve. A customer overheard the exchange. "" You look weary,"" the old woman said, coming up to the deli counter. I looked down at her. Hunched and wizened, she looked far too old to be wandering about on her own. She was dressed in a distinctive foreign style, but I couldn't quite pin down which one. She turned her milky blue eyes up at me and held out her hand. "" Does me no good now. No children, and not long for this world. You seem like nice young man."" I took the object from her - a small green gem, maybe a half-inch across, cut with many facets. It glittered darkly in the store's light. I thought I saw a small pulsing object embedded within, but it might have just been a trick of the internal reflections. ""I can't take this,"" I told her, eyes wide. "" It's against company policy."" ""Not worth any money,"" she said. "" You can take. It helps you."" ""Helps me?"" The skin around her mouth was the color and consistency of aged parchment, and I stared as it moved. Her lips curled up into a weak smile. "" Tell it what you want, then make cut in your skin and put it inside."" I recoiled. "" That's disgusting!"" She squeezed my hand around the gem, smiled one more time, and then hobbled off. Desperation can do odd things to a man. It can take away his fear, and give him a false bravery. I stared at the gem for the next few days, mesmerized by its emerald inner glow and by the possibility of her claims. I washed it with rubbing alcohol once or twice, just to make sure it was clean. Had it been inside someone else before? I put the gem away, intending to sell it, until a comment from my *other* boss set me off. ""Keep up these hours, and you'll go places!"" He'd meant it in good faith, but I could only nod, my heart burning. How could I *possibly* keep up extreme hours at *both* jobs? I went home in an exhausted rage, and got a knife. I chose a spot on the inside of my arm, in the meat just past the elbow, and made an incision. I thrust the gem inside, shivered at the odd feeling, and then stitched it all up. I passed out in bed, my arm leaking spots of red along my sheets. Of course, I felt like an idiot when I finally woke up. Not only had I cut a hole in my arm and put a strange object inside, I'd forgotten to set an alarm, and I was three hours late for my shift! I dressed and hurried over only to stop dead in my tracks outside the store. Through the window, I saw someone already there, handling my tasks. It was *me* another me! I stared down at my arm, where dark emerald veins pulsed around the gem I'd made part of me. Had I just gotten so tired that I'd lost my mind? Or was I really seeing another me, working in my place? What did that mean for me? Where would the other me sleep? Where would he live? Was he aware that he was a duplicate? I could work both jobs now but share the expenses? Pay for food for two people? The gem had been trying to help, as the old woman had said, but that good will was misguided in the face of cold, hard economics. My heart raced the entire day as I waited. I knew what I had to do, and I knew how to do it. I'd seen enough movies - duplications like this always ended in murder. Perhaps I was jumping the gun by going immediately for violence, but I only had one chance. As soon as he realized I existed, he would be on guard for this, because he was me, and he would know my thoughts. I waited in the shower, behind the curtain. I knew myself, so I knew he would come in and nervously eye the closed curtain as he always did. I never *really* thought someone was behind it, but god, what if there was? I always slid it open before I brushed my teeth, just to make sure. This time, he finally found something. I leapt forward with the hammer as he pulled back the curtain, and his forehead crumpled in around the metal head. He fell to the floor, twitching, and staring up at me in confusion but a few more squelching blows put a stop to that. I dragged his body to the loose floorboards under my kitchen area, and hid him in the four-foot high crawlspace I'd found underneath. A few chemicals I'd learned of on the Internet would take care of the smell and that was that. Except for the bloodstain on the bathroom floor, and the splatter on the curtain - which I threw out - there was no evidence my duplicate had ever existed. I scrubbed away at the stain, took a shower, and then passed out, relieved. I awoke before my alarm, at 6:59 just in time to see another me appear in the other half of the bed. He didn't stand a chance. I grabbed the hammer from the nightstand and slammed it into him repeatedly before he even had a moment to comprehend what was happening. "" No, wait -!"" He never got to finish his sentence. His body joined the first under the floor. I worked my two shifts that day, and then went home, realizing that I had a bigger problem on my hands. I tried to pry the emerald out of my arm, but the strange veins had hardened into my skin, and I couldn't even cut the thing out without taking off my whole arm. Just as I'd expected, at seven in the morning, a third me appeared. This was, apparently, going to happen every single morning for the rest of my life I'd wanted to be in two places at once, and do more than humanly possible, and the throbbing gem in my arm had given me that capability. I just had to think outside the box. It took a while to come around to what I knew I would have to do. For several months, I murdered myself each morning, and then went to work, a little more haunted and tired. The screams got me every time. They were *my* screams and how did I know I wouldn't be the one waking up with a hammer to the head the next morning? I tried not to think about it even as I created more efficient means of instant death for my duplicates. A few months after *that*, I ran out of willpower. I quit my jobs. At first, it was because I had a sub-basement full to the brim with corpse versions of me, enough that they couldn't fit under the floorboards anymore. Then, it was because I was selling the duplicate set of clothes that came with them each day, and living off that money. I invested in a nice suit, went to sleep in it, woke up, murdered myself very carefully, and then sold the new suit to someone else. When my buyers started asking questions, I had to go legitimate, and open a business. Only, I didn't sell suits. I didn't have enough inventory for that. I could only produce one set of clothes a day, and that would never be enough
So, I innovated. I'd already worked at a deli, so I used that experience. Now I run the most popular butcher shop on the west side. You should come by and check us out some time. We're having a sale. The best cuts are half off and the meat is sourced entirely locally. ---

<URL>
I won't be trying it just yet but there isn't much you can do with a stubborn problem other that to experiment. Your sleep pattern sounds a little like mine in that I would get up to 3-4 nights of half-reasonable sleep in a row and then it would suddenly drop out for no apparent reason. I had recently stopped taking Amitriptylene (Elavil) and things got a lot worse. I then restarted the Elavil along with magnesium which I started taking about 3 weeks ago. My sleep pattern hasn't improved much but my mood is far better and I can cope on the sleep I get. I think that the main thing that is working is the magnesium as I never felt so alert on just Elavil. If you haven't tried it then Magnesium may be worth a shot. Use either Magnesium Citrate or Taurate an hour before bed for a couple of weeks. Any extra Mg will pass out through the kidneys so as long as they are functioning OK there shouldn't be a problem. 60 capsules cost about £10 on Amazon so it is an easy and cheap option to try. I am not sure it will work with PTSD but you gotta keep trying things. I think that Mg works mostly for depression of which a secondary symptom is insomnia. I assume you have spent time with a psychologist/counsellor to work through the PTSD issues, but if not then maybe that is worth a shot as well. Good luck with the acupuncture, I hope it works for you and I would be interested in hearing the result.",My sleep pattern hasn't improved much but my mood is far better and I can cope on the sleep I get.,627,3,1

I'm not even kidding. She really said that. And she is a university doctor! 1. It would make me feel better if I were able to get proper treatment for the ailments that I have. I DIDN'T COME HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FAIRY GODMOTHER! I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU WERE A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE! And that is just the most recent doctors visit I have had the displeasure of experiencing. But it is a pretty good representation of the past dozen or so. All I want is for them to treat me like my illness is not somehow something I am managing to do to myself because I am a shitty person and actually treat me. It would also be wonderful if they even mildly respected my knowledge of my own body. I don't even know what to do now. I just can't get through to any of them. I told my pcp recently that I think I have POTS and she completely ignored me and continued asking me the same shit she does every time I see her and then telling me my diet is shitty and I need to exercise. Even though I am not even overweight. She also seems to be convinced that I have some kind of std despite the fact that I have had the same monogamous partner for a year and a half and haven't even had sex with him since I left home for treatment months ago. I'm also clearly not running around shooting up meth. Okay now I am just bitching. My point was that since doctors don't actually like to listen to people maybe I can get their attention with medical words and bright colors. So I made a very child like flow chart (it was going to look nicer but I was in a hurry). All my symptoms and traits are in green and connected to the corresponding condition.

Its been exactly one year since Jen left. That means its been one year and one day since I was fired. I havent worked since. I used to like the idea of being on disability; free money and all the time in the world to spend with her. I guess she didnt think of it that way. She was always ambitious. I shouldnt say was. Every day I see Facebook updates detailing her constant successes. The most recent one was her engagement. Id never seen her look so happy. I guess I knew things with us were going downhill when I looked forward to our fights. Shed always say something about how Im so smart - that I was smarter than she, in fact - but that I had no ambition. It felt so good to hear that someone as brilliant as Jen thought I was smart, even though she yelled it at me in frustration. She claimed she understood my depression and my anxiety and how they were terrible roadblocks on the path to my happiness. I thought that meant she could empathize and still wanted to be with me anyway. Apparently I was wrong. Getting disability benefits for my depression wasnt too hard. The money isnt great, but it pays the rent and keeps me fed. The only pain is that I have to go to therapy every week. I also need to go to monthly appointments to pick up prescriptions to help combat my depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Its all so procedural and detached from anything resembling real care. So Im a lonely, unemployable loser who apparently has this great mind thats utterly useless. But I wont stay like this forever. Ive discovered a something new. Well, something old, actually. Today begins my new life. The medication never worked, the therapy never worked, the behavior changes never worked. Medicine failed me. Or maybe I failed medicine. Either way, Im taking control of myself again. Im not going to be a victim of the barriers my bodys put up for me. No more attention problems. No more depression. No more anxiety. For the first time in what may be decades, Im filled with hope. *August 1, 2015, 3:00pm*
All my tools are cleaned and ready. In about an hour, Ill start. I need to keep a pretty comprehensive journal of the procedure to make sure Im not harming myself.

After I traced a dime-sized circle on the upper-right part of my forehead, I used an Exacto knife to carve through the skin. I wasnt prepared for how much this was going to hurt. I stopped a couple times to wipe away the tears so I could see well enough to continue. The skin lifted off from the bone without too much trouble once Id finished cutting. I flushed it down the toilet. Now Im waiting for the bleeding to stop - it seems to be slowing already. Its so weird to see my skull exposed like this. Im going to write a sentence or two before and after each of the next steps so I can get as good a description as possible if this all works as well as Im hoping. I opted to use a tiny drill bit over a single large one. A ring of tiny holes is going to take a hell of a lot longer, but I think the need for precision dwarfs time consumption in this case. Im about to do the first hole. The first hole is done. Imagine the feeling of biting down on a fist-sized piece of tinfoil as hard as you possibly can while your head hums like its filled with buzzing hornets. The vibration was so excruciating that Im only now feeling the pain of the drill site itself. Im going to do the next ten or so holes now before I lose my nerve. The vibrations became less intense with each hole. The bone pain got much worse, though. Ive never had migraines, but I assume they must feel something like this. Im shining a light at the ring of tiny bores and doing my best to inspect whats behind them in the mirror. Its not very useful. The remaining structural elements between the holes are extremely thin and brittle-looking. Im going to cut them away with the wirecutters. I just dropped a circle of my skull into the sink. Now Im looking at the bright red membrane thats covering my brain. Im a little surprised by how many blood vessels are in there. Im going to put out a couple more towels. Cutting away the membrane is the part Im most scared of. Its done and the hole is bleeding a *lot*. Im taking extra care to not put too much pressure on the organ itself when Im working to soak up the blood. Im feeling a little dizzy so while I hold the towel to the hole, Im sitting and eating the piece of steak and drinking the orange juice Id put out just in case this happened. The wound is slowly starting to clot while I wait here. The whole area hurts, but the pain is second to the strong pulsing sensation around the hole. Its almost like I have a second heart beating there. The blood stopped pouring out and Im cleaning the area with water and rubbing alcohol. Now I can see my brain. It doesnt look like it even belongs to me; I dont know why it all feels so surreal. Its almost like Im watching all this happen to someone else. On the plus side, Im not dizzy anymore, but Im exhausted. Im going to bandage everything and go to bed. Ill clean up tomorrow. *August 2, 2015, 6:30am*
I woke up this morning with more energy and drive than Ive ever felt. Even sitting here writing this feels like a joy; Im not struggling to find words, Im not dreading how Ill reread what Ive written and think its stupid and pointless -- everything just.works. The accounts Id read about people who shared their experiences with trepanation made similar claims, but even as I drilled the holes I never allowed myself to truly believe it would work for me. Even now, Im worried its all just a placebo effect. The pulsating feeling is real, though, and its as strong as ever. That was something else my fellow trepanned mentioned. They said it was because the body is letting the brain grow again; something the skull had prevented after it hardened following infancy. I dont know if I buy the explanation, but I cant deny whats happening here. *August 2, 2015, 2:00pm*
My days been spent cleaning the apartment. Over the last year, Id let things pile up and grow increasingly filthy as my depression festered. Today, its like a veil has been lifted and light is pouring over everything I lay my eyes on. The place needed to be cleaned, so I just set to work and cleaned it. It looks better now than it did when Jen and I moved in. My therapist recommended that I clean quite a while ago, suggesting that a nice, open area would really help me see my home as a place for potential, rather than stagnation. Now I know what he meant. This is what potential feels like. The hole in my head still hurts and it looks terrible, but I expected as much. If I go out, I can wear a hat and no one will notice anything amiss. Im not ready to do that, though. Im mildly concerned about how badly the site is beginning to itch as it heals. Im being extremely assiduous in cleaning and caring for the wound as it heals, but I guess part of that process is that damn itch. Im doing my best not to think about it. *August 2, 2015, 11:30pm*
The first full day of my experiment is about to end. Im about to go to sleep, and I feel like Ive accomplished a lot today. My home is spotless, Ive finished a short story Id been working on for the last couple months, Ive gotten up to date with my internet and utility bills, and I even did a couple sets of push-ups. I had to remind myself to eat, though. For whatever reason, I wasnt hungry at all until I realized it was nearly 9pm and I hadnt eaten all day. Im chalking it up to my excitement. Its been hard to contain. But, now Im all showered and pajamaed and ready to end my day. I cant wait for tomorrow. *August 3, 2015, 5:45am*
I was up before my alarm this morning to watch the sun rise from the roof of the apartment. Last night I slept like a log and didnt wake up once. I noticed some blood on my pillow and under my fingernails, though, and I think I may have scratched underneath the bandage while I slept. I made a beeline to the bathroom to inspect the hole and, thankfully, I didnt seem to do any damage. Everything appears to be healing well. *August 3, 2015, 1:15pm*
I dont know if its endorphins wearing off or just an artefact of my depression, but my euphoric feeling has diminished quite a bit since this morning. Im thinking it might be both; maybe I need to have a good meal. There should be something in the fridge. *August 3, 2015, 9:00pm*
Whatever I felt this afternoon doesnt seem to have been a fluke. While my mood elevated for a little while after lunch, I was back to near-baseline for the rest of the day and evening. The pulsing in the hole waxes and wanes with my mood, interestingly enough. When Im happy and ambitious, it pulses a lot. When Im depressed, it may pulse once every ten seconds. It may have something to do with my blood pressure, so Ill keep an eye on that. Before bed, Ill do some jumping-jacks and see if the pulsing returns. Im fairly certain a higher pulse rate correlates with a better mindset. Just did the exercise. The pulsing is the same. My heartrate is up, but my mood is still low. Im going to bed. *August 4, 2015, 11:00am*
I just woke up and I feel terrible. I was scratching the hole again. The pillow is soaked with blood and there are remnants of scabs under my fingernails. Tonight Ill wear gloves. That aside, my mood is still right near where it was before I started this process. Im worried the surface area of my brain thats exposed isnt large enough to allow long-lasting effects. I dont trust myself to widen the hole thats already there, but Im prepared to do another one an inch or so away. *August 4, 2015, 12:30pm*
There was a problem with the second hole. I did everything just like the last time, but on the last tiny borehole a crack formed in the skull between the original hole and the new site. I had to peel back the skin Id left to make sure, but it was definitely there. I was forced to decide whether or not I should leave the broken piece, and I opted against it. Now I have an oval thats about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Removing the membrane from this part was difficult and I had a minor issue with the blade slipping deeper than Id wanted. Thankfully, the brain has no pain receptors. It couldnt have gone more than half an inch inside and nothing weird happened to my body so I lucked out and hit part of the 90% they say we dont use. I know people are saying thats a myth, but with what just happened to me there must be some truth to it. *August 5, 2015, 8:00am*
No scratching overnight. The pulsing is there but its nowhere near as strong as it was the first time. My mood is still low. I have to be honest with myself here: I feel like a failure. This whole experiment is another example of me setting out to do something with good intentions and having it all blow up in my face. But, *but*, Im not going to be defeated by it. In the past, I wouldve stopped, Jen wouldve started a fight with me, and Id just add it to the never ending cascade of fuckups that form my identity. Not this time, though. The increase in my ambition from this treatment must still be going strong, because Im determined to see it all through. *August 5, 2015, 8:00pm*
There are four more holes in my head. I didnt think Id be able to do it. Toward the end of the last one, I almost passed out. Im glad I had the foresight to keep a few sugar packets nearby so I could regain the strength to finish up. Besides the issue with my dizziness, these four went better than the prior two. I used the left and right sides of my head this time, right above my ears. The skull was *far* thinner than on my forehead, so the vibration of the drill wasnt as excruciating. The blood-loss was significantly greater, though, which explains the desire to pass out. I have hand towels wrapped around my head so I wont get blood all over the place. Lucky for me, Im a pretty quick clotter. Thats a funny word. *August 6, 2015, 6:10am*
I slept sitting up and awoke to *major* pulsing not just in the new holes, but in the old ones as well. A small problems developed with the second hole, though. I think it might be getting infected. The itching is unbearable and I think it might be starting to smell. I poured rubbing alcohol on all the sides and pressed it in with clean towels, so hopefully thatll stop whatevers breeding in there. My mood was pretty high. Still not as good as the first day, but much better than the days after. Ive been thinking about Jen a lot. We had so many things in common. We loved talking about animals and used to go off on tangents where wed discuss all the exotic ones wed have when we were rich. Her favorite ones were rhinos. Mine were hippos. I used to tell her about the lake wed have in our backyard where my pygmy hippo would play with her baby rhino. After theyd gotten tired out, wed invite them up to the patio where theyd curl up next to one another while we gazed adoringly at them and at each other. I wonder how shed feel knowing Ive been doing all this work to better myself. Shed probably tell me to do more. *August 7, 2015, 12:35pm*
I did more. All day yesterday, I drilled. I drilled and cut and pulled and peeled. I feel like I can take on the world; its almost like that one time I did cocaine in college, but the effect has lasted far longer. Ill update again today if I have to, but for now, Im going to work on some of my stories. *August 9, 2015, 9:00am*
Where have I been? Since the other day, Ive gotten down 100 pages of a story I never even knew I had in me. Reading it over is like Im looking at the work of someone else. Someone far, far better. A stranger, I guess. On a slightly less pleasant note, theres definitely an infection in a few holes. One of them is weeping a gray liquid that smells terrible and all of them itch. When I rub them with the towel to try to scratch, they break open and start either bleeding or leaking clear fluid. I figure its like a cold that has to run its course, but Ill be damned if it isnt becoming a problem nearly as bad as the depression was. *August 10, 2015, 7:40am*
I scratched in my sleep. I dont know what else to say other than it was bad. Its hard to tell from what I see in the mirror, but I might have damaged some of my brain in the holes of my forehead and left side. A small piece is hanging by a thread that looks like a tiny blood vessel. I tried to tuck it back under the lip of skull, but I had to press pretty hard to do it and Im worried I messed it up even worse. At least I saw a bear today. *August 15, 2015, 4:15pm*
More holes for me. Shaved my head. No more hair, lots more holes. Remember those wiffle balls from when we were kids? One day Ill tell Jen how I thought my head looked like a wiffle ball. She always liked baseball and playing with my hair. My head infection was getting real bad before the bear came. Now he licks my head while I sleep and keeps the gross stuff out. Jen loves bears. Bears and rhinos. Every morning I have to clean under my fingernails a lot. Petting the bear gets them real dirty. Its nice the bear shaved when I did so I didnt have to feel like the odd man out. Those pulses in my head are nice and strong all the time. It feels good. The bear licks me a lot when I sleep. *Augs 16, 2015 5000*
Scratch the bear by his ears andhe licks lots and lots. Lots of licks means a lot less itching. Jen would scratch my back when it was itchy. One time she saw me triing to scratch between my shoulders using the door frame. She called me a bear because thats what bears do when there back itches. 60 holes, going to cut out the spaces in between. Make my bear proud if Jen cant be. <URL>",I have to be honest with myself here: I feel like a failure.,10776,6,1

Its been exactly one year since Jen left. That means its been one year and one day since I was fired. I havent worked since. I used to like the idea of being on disability; free money and all the time in the world to spend with her. I guess she didnt think of it that way. She was always ambitious. I shouldnt say was. Every day I see Facebook updates detailing her constant successes. The most recent one was her engagement. Id never seen her look so happy. I guess I knew things with us were going downhill when I looked forward to our fights. Shed always say something about how Im so smart - that I was smarter than she, in fact - but that I had no ambition. It felt so good to hear that someone as brilliant as Jen thought I was smart, even though she yelled it at me in frustration. She claimed she understood my depression and my anxiety and how they were terrible roadblocks on the path to my happiness. I thought that meant she could empathize and still wanted to be with me anyway. Apparently I was wrong. Getting disability benefits for my depression wasnt too hard. The money isnt great, but it pays the rent and keeps me fed. The only pain is that I have to go to therapy every week. I also need to go to monthly appointments to pick up prescriptions to help combat my depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Its all so procedural and detached from anything resembling real care. So Im a lonely, unemployable loser who apparently has this great mind thats utterly useless. But I wont stay like this forever. Ive discovered a something new. Well, something old, actually. Today begins my new life. The medication never worked, the therapy never worked, the behavior changes never worked. Medicine failed me. Or maybe I failed medicine. Either way, Im taking control of myself again. Im not going to be a victim of the barriers my bodys put up for me. No more attention problems. No more depression. No more anxiety. For the first time in what may be decades, Im filled with hope. *August 1, 2015, 3:00pm*
All my tools are cleaned and ready. In about an hour, Ill start. I need to keep a pretty comprehensive journal of the procedure to make sure Im not harming myself. I figure a running account of my experiences will give evidence of the positive (or negative) changes in both my mood and cognitive abilities. *August 1, 2015, 4:05pm*
After I traced a dime-sized circle on the upper-right part of my forehead, I used an Exacto knife to carve through the skin. I wasnt prepared for how much this was going to hurt. I stopped a couple times to wipe away the tears so I could see well enough to continue. The skin lifted off from the bone without too much trouble once Id finished cutting. I flushed it down the toilet. Now Im waiting for the bleeding to stop - it seems to be slowing already. Its so weird to see my skull exposed like this. Im going to write a sentence or two before and after each of the next steps so I can get as good a description as possible if this all works as well as Im hoping. I opted to use a tiny drill bit over a single large one. A ring of tiny holes is going to take a hell of a lot longer, but I think the need for precision dwarfs time consumption in this case. Im about to do the first hole. The first hole is done. Imagine the feeling of biting down on a fist-sized piece of tinfoil as hard as you possibly can while your head hums like its filled with buzzing hornets. The vibration was so excruciating that Im only now feeling the pain of the drill site itself. Im going to do the next ten or so holes now before I lose my nerve. The vibrations became less intense with each hole. The bone pain got much worse, though. Ive never had migraines, but I assume they must feel something like this. Im shining a light at the ring of tiny bores and doing my best to inspect whats behind them in the mirror. Its not very useful. The remaining structural elements between the holes are extremely thin and brittle-looking. Im going to cut them away with the wirecutters. I just dropped a circle of my skull into the sink. Now Im looking at the bright red membrane thats covering my brain. Im a little surprised by how many blood vessels are in there. Im going to put out a couple more towels. Cutting away the membrane is the part Im most scared of. Its done and the hole is bleeding a *lot*. Im taking extra care to not put too much pressure on the organ itself when Im working to soak up the blood. Im feeling a little dizzy so while I hold the towel to the hole, Im sitting and eating the piece of steak and drinking the orange juice Id put out just in case this happened. The wound is slowly starting to clot while I wait here. The whole area hurts, but the pain is second to the strong pulsing sensation around the hole. Its almost like I have a second heart beating there. The blood stopped pouring out and Im cleaning the area with water and rubbing alcohol. Now I can see my brain. It doesnt look like it even belongs to me; I dont know why it all feels so surreal. Its almost like Im watching all this happen to someone else. On the plus side, Im not dizzy anymore, but Im exhausted. Im going to bandage everything and go to bed. Ill clean up tomorrow. *August 2, 2015, 6:30am*
I woke up this morning with more energy and drive than Ive ever felt. Even sitting here writing this feels like a joy; Im not struggling to find words, Im not dreading how Ill reread what Ive written and think its stupid and pointless -- everything just.works. The accounts Id read about people who shared their experiences with trepanation made similar claims, but even as I drilled the holes I never allowed myself to truly believe it would work for me. Even now, Im worried its all just a placebo effect. The pulsating feeling is real, though, and its as strong as ever. That was something else my fellow trepanned mentioned. They said it was because the body is letting the brain grow again; something the skull had prevented after it hardened following infancy. I dont know if I buy the explanation, but I cant deny whats happening here. *August 2, 2015, 2:00pm*
My days been spent cleaning the apartment. Over the last year, Id let things pile up and grow increasingly filthy as my depression festered. Today, its like a veil has been lifted and light is pouring over everything I lay my eyes on. The place needed to be cleaned, so I just set to work and cleaned it. It looks better now than it did when Jen and I moved in. My therapist recommended that I clean quite a while ago, suggesting that a nice, open area would really help me see my home as a place for potential, rather than stagnation. Now I know what he meant. This is what potential feels like. The hole in my head still hurts and it looks terrible, but I expected as much. If I go out, I can wear a hat and no one will notice anything amiss. Im not ready to do that, though. Im mildly concerned about how badly the site is beginning to itch as it heals. Im being extremely assiduous in cleaning and caring for the wound as it heals, but I guess part of that process is that damn itch. Im doing my best not to think about it. *August 2, 2015, 11:30pm*
The first full day of my experiment is about to end. Im about to go to sleep, and I feel like Ive accomplished a lot today. My home is spotless, Ive finished a short story Id been working on for the last couple months, Ive gotten up to date with my internet and utility bills, and I even did a couple sets of push-ups. I had to remind myself to eat, though. For whatever reason, I wasnt hungry at all until I realized it was nearly 9pm and I hadnt eaten all day. Im chalking it up to my excitement. Its been hard to contain. But, now Im all showered and pajamaed and ready to end my day. I cant wait for tomorrow. *August 3, 2015, 5:45am*
I was up before my alarm this morning to watch the sun rise from the roof of the apartment. Last night I slept like a log and didnt wake up once. I noticed some blood on my pillow and under my fingernails, though, and I think I may have scratched underneath the bandage while I slept. I made a beeline to the bathroom to inspect the hole and, thankfully, I didnt seem to do any damage. Everything appears to be healing well. *August 3, 2015, 1:15pm*
I dont know if its endorphins wearing off or just an artefact of my depression, but my euphoric feeling has diminished quite a bit since this morning. Im thinking it might be both; maybe I need to have a good meal. There should be something in the fridge. *August 3, 2015, 9:00pm*
Whatever I felt this afternoon doesnt seem to have been a fluke. While my mood elevated for a little while after lunch, I was back to near-baseline for the rest of the day and evening. The pulsing in the hole waxes and wanes with my mood, interestingly enough. When Im happy and ambitious, it pulses a lot. When Im depressed, it may pulse once every ten seconds. It may have something to do with my blood pressure, so Ill keep an eye on that. Before bed, Ill do some jumping-jacks and see if the pulsing returns. Im fairly certain a higher pulse rate correlates with a better mindset. Just did the exercise. The pulsing is the same. My heartrate is up, but my mood is still low. Im going to bed. *August 4, 2015, 11:00am*
I just woke up and I feel terrible. I was scratching the hole again. The pillow is soaked with blood and there are remnants of scabs under my fingernails. Tonight Ill wear gloves. That aside, my mood is still right near where it was before I started this process. Im worried the surface area of my brain thats exposed isnt large enough to allow long-lasting effects. I dont trust myself to widen the hole thats already there, but Im prepared to do another one an inch or so away. *August 4, 2015, 12:30pm*
There was a problem with the second hole. I did everything just like the last time, but on the last tiny borehole a crack formed in the skull between the original hole and the new site. I had to peel back the skin Id left to make sure, but it was definitely there. I was forced to decide whether or not I should leave the broken piece, and I opted against it. Now I have an oval thats about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Removing the membrane from this part was difficult and I had a minor issue with the blade slipping deeper than Id wanted. Thankfully, the brain has no pain receptors. It couldnt have gone more than half an inch inside and nothing weird happened to my body so I lucked out and hit part of the 90% they say we dont use. I know people are saying thats a myth, but with what just happened to me there must be some truth to it. *August 5, 2015, 8:00am*
No scratching overnight. The pulsing is there but its nowhere near as strong as it was the first time. My mood is still low. I have to be honest with myself here: I feel like a failure. This whole experiment is another example of me setting out to do something with good intentions and having it all blow up in my face. But, *but*, Im not going to be defeated by it. In the past, I wouldve stopped, Jen wouldve started a fight with me, and Id just add it to the never ending cascade of fuckups that form my identity. Not this time, though. The increase in my ambition from this treatment must still be going strong, because Im determined to see it all through. *August 5, 2015, 8:00pm*
There are four more holes in my head. I didnt think Id be able to do it. Toward the end of the last one, I almost passed out. Im glad I had the foresight to keep a few sugar packets nearby so I could regain the strength to finish up. Besides the issue with my dizziness, these four went better than the prior two. I used the left and right sides of my head this time, right above my ears. The skull was *far* thinner than on my forehead, so the vibration of the drill wasnt as excruciating. The blood-loss was significantly greater, though, which explains the desire to pass out. I have hand towels wrapped around my head so I wont get blood all over the place. Lucky for me, Im a pretty quick clotter. Thats a funny word. *August 6, 2015, 6:10am*
I slept sitting up and awoke to *major* pulsing not just in the new holes, but in the old ones as well. A small problems developed with the second hole, though. I think it might be getting infected. The itching is unbearable and I think it might be starting to smell. I poured rubbing alcohol on all the sides and pressed it in with clean towels, so hopefully thatll stop whatevers breeding in there. My mood was pretty high. Still not as good as the first day, but much better than the days after. Ive been thinking about Jen a lot. We had so many things in common. We loved talking about animals and used to go off on tangents where wed discuss all the exotic ones wed have when we were rich. Her favorite ones were rhinos. Mine were hippos. I used to tell her about the lake wed have in our backyard where my pygmy hippo would play with her baby rhino. After theyd gotten tired out, wed invite them up to the patio where theyd curl up next to one another while we gazed adoringly at them and at each other. I wonder how shed feel knowing Ive been doing all this work to better myself. Shed probably tell me to do more. *August 7, 2015, 12:35pm*
I did more. All day yesterday, I drilled. I drilled and cut and pulled and peeled. I feel like I can take on the world; its almost like that one time I did cocaine in college, but the effect has lasted far longer. Ill update again today if I have to, but for now, Im going to work on some of my stories. *August 9, 2015, 9:00am*
Where have I been? Since the other day, Ive gotten down 100 pages of a story I never even knew I had in me. Reading it over is like Im looking at the work of someone else. Someone far, far better. A stranger, I guess. On a slightly less pleasant note, theres definitely an infection in a few holes. One of them is weeping a gray liquid that smells terrible and all of them itch. When I rub them with the towel to try to scratch, they break open and start either bleeding or leaking clear fluid. I figure its like a cold that has to run its course, but Ill be damned if it isnt becoming a problem nearly as bad as the depression was. *August 10, 2015, 7:40am*
I scratched in my sleep. I dont know what else to say other than it was bad. Its hard to tell from what I see in the mirror, but I might have damaged some of my brain in the holes of my forehead and left side. A small piece is hanging by a thread that looks like a tiny blood vessel. I tried to tuck it back under the lip of skull, but I had to press pretty hard to do it and Im worried I messed it up even worse. At least I saw a bear today. *August 15, 2015, 4:15pm*

I was working really hard to be healthy at the start. I am on a fairly strict diet to make sure I'm eating enough and healthily (while still losing weight at a reasonable rate).

I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt. Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous. So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided. I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do. I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie. I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start. So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys!",I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still.,2087,4,1

Anyway, the variety of looks I got made me incredibly uncomfortable. Being a white punk in a dominantly black southern area that happens a lot anyway. But a lot of the looks were either the sympathetic 'bless yer heart' looks or they would look at me like I'm a jerk for using a scooter that someone unwell might need.

s_891_1158,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"I Quit My Job To Participate In a Sleeping Experiment Three months ago I made the spontaneous decision to get myself involved in an experiment. I am required to lie on a bed for six straight months while sleeping at least twelve hours a day. While I was walking down my street to catch a cab to work a man approached me with a big smile on his face. He told me if I wanted to make 150k in six months. Intrigued, I asked him what I had to do. With a smile he told me to go with him to his office about 3 minutes away walking distance. I promise Im not one to just follow anyone to a location I know nothing about, but South Korea is equipped with cameras all over the streets and roads. Just to be safe I texted my buddy who worked right beside me to call the cops if I dont call him within the next 2 hours, and I texted him the address of the office once we got there. Feeling assured that I had all of my bases covered I followed the man into the building. When we got inside I was amazed by how white everything was. The desks, floors, ceiling, wall, chairs, and even the outfits that the workers inside wore were all solid white. I couldnt help but stare at everything while we walked towards the back of the building. When we get to the back hallway of the building I notice everything is white here except for the doors. There are 3 doors in the back and each door is a different color. The first door is blue, the second is yellow, and the last is red. He stops in front of the blue door and opens it. Holy shit, everything in the room is solid blue. I also notice that there is a huge bed with blankets, pillows, and frame which are all completely blue. It really looks like a normal bedroom with a tv in front of the bed and a laptop in the middle of the bed. He pulled out two chairs and patted on one as he sat in the other. I sat down beside him and he pulled out a piece of paper. Rules was written on the top with a list and a line for me to sign at the bottom. The list stated the following:
1) You will not be able to leave your bed during the six months you are here. 2) You are to sleep for at least 12 hours a day. 3) You have access to the laptop and your phone, but you must never reveal what you are doing. 4) Every two months we will move your bed to another room. We will move you, but it is very important that you stay in the same position you were in while you were lying down. 5) When you receive your food you may put your head up to eat, but at least half of your back must be on the bed. 6) If you need to use the restroom press the button on the side of the bed. We have a way for you to use the restroom without you having to leave the bed. 7) If you feel sick press the button twice and we will send someone to assist you. 8) Once the six months is up you will be given the 150k on a card. If you lose the card we will not be able to replace it for you. X________________________
I feel a little weird about having to stay in the bed for 6 months,
but I do love to sleep and being paid to sleep for 12 hours seems like a complete luxury. Plus, I will still be able to use a laptop and my phone while Im lying down so I wont be bored at all. I can just log into my Netflix and watch every single show I have been meaning to watch. I call up my buddy and tell him that I am quitting my job and that
I found a better opportunity. He asked me what it was, but I had already hung up on him by then. I let my manager know that I am quitting as well and hang up on him while he was cussing me out and screaming at me about how
I completely screwed his team up. I know I just ruined my chances of ever going back to my job and also getting another job in Korea, but once this 6 months is up Im going back to the states and finally starting my own restaurant. Once I signed the contract the man handed me a pair of white pajamas. I changed into the pajamas and got on the bed. The first 3 weeks go by and I start to run out of things to watch on the laptop. I dont have anyone I really talk to, and my buddy has stopped talking to me when I wouldnt tell him where I am working now. I have never been close to my family and whenever I try calling my mother and father they dont pick up the phone. The strange thing is; no matter how bored I am I still feel somewhat happy. I think about how much the money will change my life. I daydream about running a successful restaurant and making a successful chain after a couple of years. I turn on the tv and start flipping through the channels. I get distracted watching this show about people flipping shit over having their cars towed for the next two hours and before I know it a person in white comes in and injects me with something that makes me fall asleep. I havent dreamt in the past three weeks, but today I finally had a dream. I am standing next to my mother and father in a Flea Market. The same place I used to go with my parents once a week until I was thirteen. We are looking at a couple of turtles to get for my aquarium when the man behind the counter approaches us. He points at one particular turtle and tells me this is the turtle I should take home. He turns it around to reveal the face of the turtle and I start to shake. It looks like a turtle everywhere else but the face; the face it had belonged to my old best friend who killed himself when he was 24. He overdosed on heroine in the dorm room we were staying at together the day before graduation. The turtle turned its face at me and slowly closed his eyes while his tongue slid out all the way to the middle of his shell. I woke up in a cold sweat, but immediately felt a wave of peace as I knew it was all a dream. For the rest of the first two months in the blue room I had the same exact dream, but for some reason as soon as I woke up I would automatically feel at peace. When the timer went off signifying that it was the end of two months they took me to the Yellow Room. Two men came in and changed my diaper (embarrassing but true) and took me to the room while I stayed in the same position. The man that brought me here was sitting on the desk waiting for me. He smiles at me and tells me that I am doing perfectly. As long as I keep still on the bed it will all be over before I know it. Everything was the same in this room as the previous room, but everything in here was solid yellow. The first two weeks in the new room I did not have that horrible dream, but I felt a little sad that I had another 4 months to go. I just really wish I had followed what my father wanted me to do and go into law. He already had a firm set up, and he was willing to offer me a six figure salary on a silver platter. He offered to pay for my schooling, but my hard headed self decided to major in English. I remember how betrayed I felt when my best friend died. He was my only friend and now hes gone. I have never found a woman that liked me making me still wait for my first date at the age of 24. I have successfully wasted the first third of my life on nonsense. The night of the sixteenth day in this room I finally had a dream. I am outside of my dorm room in college. I find the key to the room in my hand so I put it in the keyhole and open the door. My friend is sitting on the bed sobbing into his hands. I walk up to him and start patting him on the shoulder and telling him everything will be okay. He starts screaming No It Wont! Nothing Will Ever Get Better! Then he slowly lifts his face up at me, and I stand there in shock. His eyes are full of sadness, but he has an inhuman smile on his face. His lips are stretched out and ripped opened to reach the middle of his cheeks and the bottom of the lip is torn to his chin. He slowly licks the bottom of his teeth before he grabs me and screams at the top of his lungs at me as his blood hits me on the face. This dream comes to me for the rest of the time I am in the yellow room, and each time I get more and more depressed about what he says. Nothing will ever get better, and I know thats the truth. I can make my own restaurant, but it will probably fail. I will be broke again, and now I wont have an opportunity to work in Korea now because I ruined the one reference I had. After the two months is up the timer goes off once more and the same two workers lift me up and take me to the final room. Once again I see the man sitting at the desk. Last room my man, after this you are done. He says that and leaves the room. I look around the room and see that it is identical to the other two rooms but red this time. I did not dream for almost the whole two months I have been in here, but anger has completely taken over all of my emotions. Why the fuck would a father kick his son out of the house for not choosing the career he wanted? I was never a bad kid and I never got in trouble. Whenever I struggled in the past couple years and asked for some help all I got was the phone hung up on me. Everyone that I have loved has left me or fucked me over. My first crush in high school laughed in my face when I asked her to prom. I fucking hate everyone I know, and I just hope they can never feel happiness again. Last night I had a dream. It was the last night I spend in here. I am standing in front of my friend. I know what just happened already by the smirk on his face. He has gone behind my back once again and has decided to go to law school and was just guaranteed the job my dad wanted to give me to him. He has just finished gloating in my face about how much more successful he would be than me, and how he just remained my friend through high school and college so that he could pursue his greatest passion. He told me how my father told him he was the son he wished he had. I already knew about it all before I came into the room. My father called me while I was in the car driving to my dorm telling me how he has no more use for me, and for me to go ahead and get all of my stuff out of his house before the end of the week. Once he is done bragging he lays on his bed and goes to sleep. I creep to his bed with a needle completely filled with heroine and find a vein. I slide the needle in fast and inject all of the heroine in to the vein on his neck. I woke back up with a smile on my face. I think the red room was my favorite.","Nothing will ever get better, and I know thats the truth.",7958,0,1

Bullying didn't really happen, and everyone fitted in (no one was left alone, unless they chose to be alone). Girls fight and hate on each other behind each other's back haha. However, my self-esteem dropped immensely some time in Grade 8. I have no idea why. I know it's related to school. I became extremely self-conscious. One of the many reasons I like to blame was that it was in Grade 8 that we started a project, which was a student exchange with kids our age in Mexico. I personally really wanted to just build a cool friendship with someone, and I was unfortunately matched with the 'hottest guy'. We talked, but soon enough I noticed him using me to get to the pretty girls of my year. When they finally came in Grade 9, I went to him to say hi, and he was like ""Hey! You're 'train_subject9951', right?"" and I was really happy he remembered me, but seconds later, he turned his back and started talking to another classmate of mine, who, for some reason, decided not to wear much that day. I was both unhappy and kind of shocked, because, well, I'm not a pretty girl. Felt like all the attention I'll ever get from there on would be from being pretty, which I am not. Girls like girls with whom they can relate to, and most girls of my school were into partying, makeup ... being stereotypical teenage girls. I was not like them.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember - even as early as Elementary school I've shown symptoms, and there's a huge percentage of depressed people in my family. I was fairly emotional during high school, like a lot of kids, but most of the time I still didn't feel like my head was really in it. I very nearly flunked out, but continuation school and my mom threatening to kick me out at 15 got me to finish. I dabbled in college courses, but never went back and I don't think I earned more than three units in something like three semesters. I had thought it would be a new beginning, something I could dive into, head first, but I hated it. I hated the people, the professors, the coursework. I had always wanted to be a writer, a novelist, but my passion for writing started to die off around that time. It's been a slow, shitty descent since then. I'm now newly 24, I've been in a serious relationship for a little over three years. I'd been in two awful ones before that, both abusive, so this guy is a breath of fresh air. He's really the only person that has made me feel truly, unconditionally loved. And that's why my depression is that much worse. His family has practically zero history of mental illness, and what is there gets swept under the rug. I've actually sat at a table, next to his mother (who doesn't know I'm depressed) while she made loud proclamations that people with mental illnesses shouldn't be allowed to own guns or have children. I've been steadily, secretly in total dislike for her since then. I just don't give a shit anymore. I have so many things to look forward to, I know that - my boyfriend and I are planning on buying a house by the end of the year, we're probably going to get married within a year or so. The few times over the last few years that I've felt real, in-your-face emotions, it's been with him. And yeah, sometimes that's anger, but mostly love. Mostly happy. But I'm so sick of the day in and day out. I've got a chronic spinal condition, it will never go away and I'm in near constant pain. It drives me crazy, knowing that I'll literally never again do anything without first thinking about my condition, about the needs of a stupid glitch in my spine above what I want to do. I self-harmed in December. I won't say much more than that about it, just that I didn't immediately regret it. Still sort of don't. I know it upset my boyfriend, and I think that's the reason I haven't done it again. I hadn't done it since high school, nine years before, and I don't plan on doing it again. It was just like a switch. I felt nothing, nothing, nothing, and then one morning I woke up and I felt everything all at once, a glimmer of happiness among waves of crushing sadness, white-hot anger, so bad I wanted to smash things, break things. That very afternoon, I was back to nothingness, or near-nothingness. You know how it is. Sometimes you feel little things throughout the day that almost make you feel like you're having a good day, until you look back on the week behind you and literally cared so less about it, in hindsight, that you can't remember a damn thing that happened. I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist, I know I should be medicated. But I procrastinate and I feel like, what, going and talking to someone and taking pills is going to magically fix me? And I'll be able to commit to things and feel normal? That's never going to happen, for me, so why bother? I just feel like I'm spending my life waiting to get better when that may never happen, and what then? I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to just go back to sleep, to pass the time. The monotony of daily life is stifling. I do look forward to weekends, to getting things done and deflating and just spending some time with my guy, but as soon as Sunday morning hits and I realize it's basically back to the work week again, I lose whatever grip on normalcy I might have had.

The feeling that even doing a simple task such as picking a sock up from the floor or having a shower is like climbing a mountain. I can feel exhausted after getting ready for work in the morning. Depression can make it difficult to enjoy life and isolates you. You do seem to be going down a route of isolation if you are thinking about leaving school - but maybe the early stages. I was as you describe when I was younger. I hated school and didn't understand why I was there, I still think that schools are really just big nurseries where society puts children so that they don't cause trouble! They are not places of great education in my opinion, they are places that frequently create sheep as fodder for society. It could be the initial start of depression, I think that racing thoughts are common but they may be more linked to anxiety than depression. The smoking may be your attempt to self medicate. In the long run you may want to educate yourself on the effects of THC when not combined with CBD. It is common for skunk to have 12-15% of THC content but very little CBD. CBD is the cannabinoid that protects against mental health issues. My best advice is to talk to a counsellor or psychologist but make up your own mind as to whether to follow their advice. They often don't seem to be much use either other than for emptying your wallet - but I am maybe a little cynical as others seem to have had great success with them. Don't be afraid to change counsellors if you do go to one, find one that suits you and that you can relate to. If you have good parents then maybe you can chat with them and let them know what you are thinking and feeling. They may be able to help with support and advice. I may be scary to approach them but good parent will want to try to help. Good luck.",Depression can make it difficult to enjoy life and isolates you.,289,1,1

Lost it all again. Help needed. I have to admit, I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I haven't even seen a therapist yet in my life. So I'm sure my problems aren't half as serious as the problems on this subreddit. Maybe I'm just weak. 28, male, single, failure, you know the usual. In any case, I would really appreciate some help. Much of the last year was spent in a haze or sorrow and anger, mostly over a girl. It's not an uncommon story. I liked her, wasn't confident, didn't tell her (also, she had a boyfriend) and so traveled to the friendzone. ( EDIT to add details: Burnt my fingers with cigarettes a few times, punched many trees and walls till my knuckles swelled up and I couldn't write a few times, drank a lot of whisky...nothing extraordinary inasmuch as life goes). Told her eventually and was told I had betrayed her
(which was true, I don't deny. I should have told her long before...but it was lack of confidence, not an intention of ... oh whatever). We became friends again. We're roommates too now, so sometimes (since I see her daily) things still hurt in my heart. You know, the usual. I am also doing a PhD in what would be considered one of the top 5 universities in my field with one of the top 2 people in my field. I said all that to indicate the irony that I'm going nowhere with it. He doesn't care what I do. If I was self-motivated enough to do something about all this, it would all work out. All I need to do is sit down and work. But I don't. You know, weak...the usual. The end of last year, I decided I would turn a new leaf and fix my life, one step at a time, however small those steps were. I told some people on this very subreddit about my brilliant idea and got a lot of encouragement, and was even told I helped one or two! I started exercising, and dressing better and walking with my back straight. It was all getting better. Then my mom got two tumours in her spine. She had one in her brain, and was on the road to recovery (or the equivalent for brain tumours). She had survived (even lived, you could say) two years longer than the 18 months she was promised. And then two completely new guys cropped up in her spine. Now she's completely immobile. I came back home to help and now can't go back to university for useless visa issues. Which means I might lose my job. The thing is, I was okay with all of this. But today morning, I realized I've lost all energy. Completely drained.

In terms of conversations, I have no way of knowing if people feel like I don't care when they tell me problems - because most of the time they talk to me once and that's it. The only person in my life who is brutally honest about my social shortcomings is my husband - learning about them at 29 is a bit late in the game. Thanks for helping me feel a little more hopeful about what a therapist could do for me, even one with very little ASD experience.","I'm starting to think that I cry when I feel frustrated, especially when I'm trying to get a point across and I can't or I feel completely helpless in any given situation.",168,0,1

s_568_543,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake ""Hollywood"" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker.

It never crossed my mind because of the distance and because I didn't want to impose myself on him and his family. I thought that I had no one at all, but apparently his family had offered to take me in a while ago.

She started shouting some particularly nasty things at me and also tried to get him to break up with me as she was putting me down. I just had a complete breakdown. He also took me to see a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with depression and they suspect borderline personality disorder, which is apparently due to my abusive childhood eventually leaving me unable to cope with stress in a productive way.

I've been travelling around quite a lot during my year off and I feel like my anxiety/depression is just getting worse. I never have panic attacks like I used to but I constantly just feel anxious. The big thing for me is my health. I am always worried about my health, primarily stds. Last year I did something stupid with a girl I didn't know and i literally convinced myself I had HIV. I went and got tested and I didn't have it which was a huge relief. But then at new year i got blackout drunk on a night out and lost some of my friends. Since then I have been worried that I have it again. For some reason I just feel like my drunk self is a total ass-hole who will completely fuck up my life given the chance. I have no reason to believe i got infected, I'm pretty sure i didn't have sex or anything but I just feel like I did something that made me get a disease. I've told myself that I will get tested again after 3 months but even if I come up negative again I don't think thats going to be the end of the problem. I feel like I always have to have one thing that I'm worrying about. It used to be a brain tumour and then I got scans and after everything came out fine I would switch my anxiety and focus on something else. But there is never a time where I'm just not worried about anything. There is always one thing that I'm fretting over in my mind and it's usually a disease of some sort. I just feel so insane. I feel like nothing good will come of me and i will end up as a tragedy, dying young of a disease with stigma attached to it through my own fault. I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should. I mean, its nearly been 3 months since new years and I am still constantly worried about having ruined my life over being blackout drunk. That just can't be normal. I feel like I don't like my inner self who is revealed when I get really drunk with friends. I have no self control and I just feel ashamed of myself. The worst part is I didn't used to feel like this. I used to love myself and be proud of things I did, I used to be my friend but I just don't feel that way anymore. I honestly look in the mirror and see someone who I'm afraid and ashamed of when I look into my own eyes. I mean how fucked up is that? Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues. Some days the anxiety will still be there in my head but I will be distracted, I'll hang out with my friends and feel happy and I don't know if I truly need help or I just occasionally feel ""Sad"" because im a young teenager with hormones in me. But every night I will go to bed and while lying there I will feel scared. Maybe of nothing in particular but just scared and filled with dread.

So I had some bad days? I am not someone who quits. I went out today and did w7d2 and told myself the entire run that this is not me starting over, this is me just continuing. This is what I do now.

I had therapy for years and the only wisdom I gained from that is that therapy is a big waste of time for me. It never helped me. Not even the slightest bit. I have also been seeing a doctor way too many times for my physical health issues and they can never find why I'm so extremely tired. Before this shit started, I was very motivated, I had plans to start and grow a large company and change the world. Now im completely failing university thining about my future, maybe its not realistic anymore to have a good career. My physical and mental health issues make EVERYTHING impossible for me.

I can't get my homework done, I can't put any effort in finding my future girlfriend, I can't put any effort in maintaining my friendships, the only things i'm capable of doing are sleeping, eating, watching youtube, chatting a little and being on reddit.

I had it for 3 years and im pretty sure I will not get therapy no matter what you try to convince me. It doesnt help me. My depression can't be cured okay? Maybe if some miracle happens and my life gets better again but thats not done with endless therapist conversations. Do not gie me medical advice I have been going to doctors and trying healthy lifestyles for years and i'm still always tired without knowing the cause. Bad physical and mental health have made it impossible for me to live my life. I cannot enjoy life and I also cannot make progress towards my future. That means im worthless. I lost all hope for my future. Is it even possible to enjoy life and chase my future dreams in this situation? I dont think so. Im not capable of anything anymore.

Ive started to just reduce all my emotions down to weather it was a positive or negative experience since my mood changes so frequently. The positives are few and far but i get them damn it feels good. So to start what are things that are causing your sadness or negative emotion? What gives you positive? What ever causes positive, follow it and try revolve your life around that emotion and chasing that. I love nothing more than smoking some good bud and sitting on the couch with my wife and kids playing games and shit. So i revolve my life around doing just that. If that means working a few shitty hours a day then its worth it to me.

I try to adapt to others at times but my social disconnection is too strong , which makes me blunt, terse, and too brutally honest.

Plus, socializing is fucking tiring . Nobody wants to be around the person who has no enthusiasm or joy in doing anything. Its for this reason many of us wind up lonely without a social life. Its for this reason many of us develop self-hate.

He was stationary, stagnant, and sad; a shuffling personification of malaise. But Old Me ended earlier today. Peer into my eyes and watch as hes devoured. In the late afternoon afternoon, I strolled through our small-town markets and malls, restaurants and theaters, touching all I could. Its amazing how oblivious people can be. Back home, a few hours later, local news reports started coming in. Biological Mystery. Impossible Pregnancies. Each headline fed my reinforcement mechanisms. Elation begat ebullience. Ebullience begat euphoria. I am the Infestor of Wombs. I wandered, undetected, through blockades and cordons and walls. When I chose to be seen, they flocked to me; women walked, girls skipped, infants crawled. Old Me peeked out from behind my eyes, only to retreat, sobbing. Gravid bellies seethed from the impatience of the lives-to-be and threatened to tear their mothers in half. I walked from home to home, invisible again, stroking the hair and skin of my surrogates, watching them smile contentedly during this brief respite from pain. Soon after, they all gave birth. Scores Dead. Devastating Deliveries. Stillbirth Epidemic. My Little Girl crawled to my home as I slept and was waiting on my doorstep the next morning. I bathed Her tiny body and removed the remainder of Her umbilical cord. She stared at me with Her radiant eyes as I poured warm water over Her skin. Extinguish the stars, She whispered, smiling. I kissed the top of her head. I am the Father of Joy. Joy grew as I fed Her throughout the day. Old Me was nearly gone; his presence only manifested as prickles down my spine as Joy raced through Her childhood and adolescence and peaked as a young woman over a period of hours. Joy told me She was ready and I followed Her into the basement. She stood in the center of the dirt floor, beaming at me with adoration. I am the Gaze of Beasts, She breathed. I heard a ripping sound as the corners of Her mouth tore to Her ears. Her teeth cracked and splintered and fell to the floor. Fingernails peeled off and fluttered to the ground like dead moths. Old Me shuddered and exhaled his dying breath. Joy was still for a moment, but then She began to change. I watched in awe as Her flesh sagged and split and the pores of Her skin gave birth to the eyes of Black God.",I feel happiness.,22,9,1

s_1581_1025,Find evidence for depressed mood in this post,"A glimpse of how I felt without my meds Context: I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was in high school (i.e. 7+ years ago). I was on cytalopram for a while but it didn't do much for me. Luckily about three years ago I found medications that worked for me. The current pills I'm taking are SNRIs, the primary agent being venlafaxine. Last Monday I was supposed to go see my psychiatrist but I was making an important call during my lunch break and I forgot. I thought to myself: what harm could it do? I had some leftovers from previous appointments and I would only miss a day's worth. How callous I was. So this is how I felt: sensory overload in every turn. Every sound delved into my head like a jackhammer. I put on earphones without listening to anything but it didn't do anything. My coworker's keyboard typing which I would normally ignore was so painful that I had to leave the room for a while. Secretaries walking fast-paced here and there hit me like a gong. It resonated within me. They irritated me and numbed me to the core at the same time. I wanted to attack someone. I turned to work to maintain focus. I work as a translator at a law firm. I usually work on court decisions, briefs, complaints, etc. I'm always fascinated by the stories I read. It lessens the inevitable boredom destined to come with the line of my profession. I picture them in my head and it helps me visualize. Concentrate. I was assigned to translate a complaint a few days ago so I was working on it. I tried to calm myself as I tried to regain control over my senses and just work. It was okay for a while until I hit the word SUICIDE. A former rep director of a company being sued had committed suicide. Normally I would just look upon it with some dismay and move on. It's really unfortunate but what can I do? In this instance I couldn't just move on. My eyes were fixed on the word. I felt like I was about to throw up. I didn't know the person. And yet the word stabbed me and I was left in shock. I wanted to cry. That was when I decided I couldn't stay in the office. I had taken the meds at that point but it wasn't working fast enough. I had to go home. I feel better now. I can withstand my surroundings once more. The words don't send me into shock like before. I thought I'd share this with you while the memory and the sensations are still fresh. My mom always tells me to ""will the depression away"". I'm not just having a bad day. I can't function without these pills. Call me a weak-willed person if you want. That doesn't change the fact that I'd just crawl into a corner and do nothing without meds.",I wanted to cry.,2007,0,1
